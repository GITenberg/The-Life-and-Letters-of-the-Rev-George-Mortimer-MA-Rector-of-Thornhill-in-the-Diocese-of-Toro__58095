<h2><a name="pagev"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
v</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Though</span> I feel it to be really a
privilege to be the instrument of introducing to the public the
life and correspondence of the most intimate friend, especially
of my early life, that I have ever possessed, and of one of the
truly excellent in the earth; yet, from an unfeigned
consciousness of my incompetency for the task, I would most
willingly have left it to other hands, and to other hands I
offered it, and urged upon them my earnest desire that they would
undertake it; but from all I received excuses as to themselves,
and pressing invitations to myself to engage in the work.&nbsp;
They conceived that I might possess more materials for the
purpose than any other person; but they knew not the slenderness
of my capacity to prepare the memoir of one whose general
character, talents and excellences, merit a much abler pen than
mine, to set them forth with perspicuity and advantage.</p>
<p>His old friend and associate at Wellington, the Rev. John
King, now Incumbent of Christ Church, <a name="pagevi"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. vi</span>Hull, to whom I wrote on the subject,
thus addressed me:&mdash;&ldquo;But independently of all
considerations of this kind, I believe you would be much better
qualified than myself, or than any other person I know, to do
justice to the excellent yet peculiar character of the
departed.&nbsp; Let me beseech you, therefore, to arrange your
correspondence and materials with a view to
publication.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His excellent and much-loved sister, Mrs. Holland, wrote to me
as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;The early, close, continued, and
personal acquaintance you had with my dear brother, constitute
you, in my opinion, his most suitable biographer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And his brother, the Rev. Thomas Mortimer, wrote to me in a
similar strain:&mdash;&ldquo;On the very day that I received your
letter, I was fully intending to write to you, <i>entreating</i>
you <i>not</i> to abandon your design of writing a memoir of your
dear departed friend, my beloved brother George.&nbsp;
<i>You</i>, above all persons I know, are the man to undertake
that work of love with any prospect of a successful issue.&nbsp;
Your own correspondence with him, through such a long series of
years, would alone furnish rich matter, I doubt not, for a
biographer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus urged and encouraged, I was unwilling not to do my best:
and if I have proved myself but an unfit steed to draw such a
chariot, the friends, at least, of my dear departed friend must
not forget that it was they who put me into it; and this same
consideration also will, I hope, lead others to view the faults
and imperfections of the work with indulgence.&nbsp; <a
name="pagevii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. vii</span>Happily for
me, the work is one rather of selection and compilation than of
original composition, and the life of my friend will suffer less
from the hand that draws it up, by reason of his speaking chiefly
for himself; his correspondence is, perhaps, his best memoir, and
this is the kind of life that it falls to my lot to prepare of
him.</p>
<p>The attentive perusal of his letters for publication has most
vividly brought to my mind and remembrance the man whom, I can
truly say, I loved almost as my own soul; very delightful was our
intercourse with one another when associated together, very close
was our intimacy, and warm and stedfast our friendship: and the
great point of union between us, the connecting link in the chain
of our connexion, was our common, and, I trust, unfeigned faith
in Christ crucified for the salvation of mankind.&nbsp; We were
neither of us originally destined for the service of the
sanctuary; but it pleased God, early in life, to call us to the
knowledge of himself, and to inspire us with an ardent desire to
preach that gospel to others, who had ourselves been made
personally sensible of the deliverance brought to the soul by
it.&nbsp; Through God&rsquo;s good providence also it was that we
were both led to the same retired and secluded village of
Chobham, in Surrey, where, under the instruction of the Rev.
Charles Jerram, then curate of the parish, but since successively
vicar of it, and Rector of Witney, Oxon, we received the
finishing part of our education preparatory to our college
course; and up to the time of our leaving the university, we were
<a name="pageviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
viii</span>personally, as well as cordially, united, in no
ordinary bonds of friendship, few days passing without our
meeting together.&nbsp; From that time our personal intercourse
may almost be said to have ceased; he spent a week with me in my
first curacy in Bedfordshire, and I spent a week with him in
Canada about two years before his death.&nbsp; In the intervening
long period, we did not meet, I think, more than once; and that
after promising one another a yearly exchange of visits, so
little dependence can be placed upon the events of time.&nbsp;
The time is coming, however, I trust, when our union will be
again renewed, and become as personal and as cordial as before,
but infinitely more pure and spiritual, and therefore more
perfect and satisfactory&mdash;subject to no painful fluctuation
or interruptions, and coeval with eternity.</p>
<p><i>Monte Video</i>, <i>January</i>, 1847.</p>
<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>LIFE AND
LETTERS.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">George Mortimer</span>, the interesting
subject of the present Memoir, was the third son of Harvey
Walklate Mortimer, the well known gun-maker in Fleet-street,
London.&nbsp; He was born May 20th, 1784; and it pleased God to
deprive him of his excellent mother the latter end of the
following year.&nbsp; Thus bereaved of watchful maternal care, he
was placed with a relative at Birmingham, who loved him
tenderly.&nbsp; His health was delicate, and the deformity which
ever after made &ldquo;his bodily presence weak,&rdquo; was
caused by suffering him to sit and lie in one posture during a
long illness, in which his restoration seemed impossible; God,
however, was graciously pleased to spare him for future
usefulness.</p>
<p>In the year 1787, his father again entered the married state,
and George and his elder brothers were treated with the fondest
attention.&nbsp; Little deserving of remark is known of the days
of his childhood and youth; as he grew in years he attained to an
average measure of bodily vigour, enjoyed a good share of health,
and was generally beloved and esteemed.&nbsp; His first
instruction was received under Doctor Hall, of East Acton; and he
finished his scholastic pursuits with the Rev. Mr. Audinet, a
French Protestant Clergyman, near the British Museum, who used to
perform divine service in French, near the Seven Dials; here, in
<a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>addition to
other attainments, he acquired a knowledge of Latin and
French.&nbsp; In November, 1798, he was bound apprentice to Mr.
Otridge, a respectable bookseller in the Strand, with whom he
continued for the usual period of seven years.</p>
<p>It is not exactly known at what period he became truly earnest
and decided in the Christian life, though it appears to have been
in the earlier years of his apprenticeship; and, as will
hereafter be seen, he considered the late Joseph Butterworth,
Esquire, for some time Member of Parliament for Dover, as his
spiritual father.&nbsp; The first notice which we have of the
state of his mind is found in a letter written to his elder
sister, to whom he was fondly attached, dated August, 1801.&nbsp;
Alluding to that happy period, he says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;When I first set out in the Christian race,
I was mocked and laughed at, but this only drove me to my
Saviour.&nbsp; I remember with what joy I could appeal to the
Lord, and say, &lsquo;Thou seest, O my God, what I endure for thy
sake;&rsquo; and I assure you no moments were spent so pleasantly
as those which I could get by myself in some retired place, to
lift up my heart to God; sweet, indeed, were the comforts I thus
enjoyed.&nbsp; I gave all into the hands of my Saviour, and
everything I undertook prospered.&nbsp; When in want of anything,
I prayed, and all my wants were supplied; indeed, I never
remember anything being held from me, but, sooner or later, I saw
it would have been hurtful.&nbsp; What encouragement to give all
into his hands!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: right">Strand, 17th March, 1802.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is with thankfulness to my kind
and indulgent God that I can tell you my soul is in a prosperous
state, and my desires after a higher degree of divine <a
name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>life greatly
increased.&nbsp; The Lord is indeed blessing me; for though I
still find wrong tempers unsubdued, these are my burden, and I
cannot rest till I find daily pardon in the Redeemer of
mankind.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Many extracts might be given from his letters written about
this time to his sister, which indicate his uncommon devotedness
to God, and his earnest desire for her advancement in the
Christian life.</p>
<p>It has already been stated that he looked upon the late Mr.
Jos. Butterworth as the instrument, in the Divine hand, which
brought him into an acquaintance with his God and Saviour.&nbsp;
Through the advice also of this same excellent man, it seems, he
was led to turn his attention towards the service of the
sanctuary; and, prior to his going up to the University, he went
to the Rev. C. Jerram&rsquo;s, to prepare himself for his
collegiate course; and from that gentleman&rsquo;s house the two
following letters to his sister were written:&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Chobham House, 5th Nov. 1806.</p>
<p>Dear Mary,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">That</span> kind and gracious God who
watches over his children for good has brought me safely to this
place.&nbsp; The country, though at present deprived of many of
its ornaments, has not lost its charms to me.&nbsp; I have now
visited my accustomed haunts, and have experienced that pleasure
in recalling past ideas, which is better conceived than
expressed.&nbsp; On this spot I am reminded of a glorious view of
the unchangeable love of God, and on that of his amazing
condescension and my astonishing vileness; here I recollect the
excellent Fenelon furnished me with pious considerations, and
there the industrious and indefatigable bee stimulated my sloth;
and the <a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>result of these recollections produced in my heart a glow
of sincere affection to that God who had so variously visited me,
and a determination to devote all my powers to the advancement of
his glory.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding my haste to leave Islington, I found, on my
arrival, I was the only one of Mr. Jerram&rsquo;s pupils who had
returned.&nbsp; At first I regretted not taking your advice, but
the spiritual treat reserved for me soon made me change my
mind.&nbsp; This treat was no less than the unexpected company of
Mr. Venn, of Clapham.&nbsp; Mr. V. had come the day before to see
Mr. Cecil, and spent that evening with Mr. Jerram.&nbsp; As it is
natural when we taste fruit of a superior flavour to wish others
to share our enjoyment, I could not help wishing my sister had
been with me to partake of the pleasures I then received.&nbsp; I
sat in all the luxury of silence, and listened to the gracious
words which fell from his lips.&nbsp; Among the many things which
warmed and charmed my heart, I think those made the greatest
impression which related to his father.&nbsp; Oh, what a
spiritual heavenly man!&nbsp; Mr. Jerram mentioned that he
considered a few hours he was permitted to spend with him as the
happiest and most profitable he ever experienced; &ldquo;and so
powerfully,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;was his conversation impressed
upon my mind, that it was uppermost in my thoughts for the
succeeding half-year.&nbsp; It was such an epocha in my Christian
life as I never enjoyed, either before or since.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This day eight years I went to Mr. Otridge&rsquo;s.&nbsp; What
a variety of changes has taken place since that period!&nbsp; Of
all I esteem that the most blessed which has brought me into my
present circumstances.&nbsp; May God so bless me in this path
that good may be imparted to my own soul, and glory ascribed to
his name.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>Chobham, 27th June, 1807.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thank</span> you for your kind,
affectionate, and Christian remembrance on my birth-day; I had
quite forgotten it; but this I remember, I was more than commonly
blessed in prayer, and had peculiar delight in reading the
Scriptures; indeed, I intended to note it down as a day of
choicest blessings.&nbsp; May God favour me with many such days
during the year on which I have entered!&nbsp; May many
pentecostal seasons be given; may much humiliation and
self-abasement before God be daily felt; may the foot of the
cross be hourly visited, and may my views be incessantly directed
to Him who lives in heaven to plead for me!</p>
<p>I received much good lately in reading Wilberforce on
Christianity.&nbsp; I took it up as a book which I thought I
ought to read, but did not expect that rich vein of excellence
which I found in almost every part of the work; his Christianity
is truly vital, and his diction admirable.&nbsp; I have also
finished the life of Judge Hale, by Burnet, and am now reading
Mr. Fletcher&rsquo;s Letters.&nbsp; I scarcely ever read a few
pages without profit; the wonderful spirit of this excellent man
frequently brings tears from my eyes; I stop and reflect, and
would give all the world, did I possess it, could I enjoy the
same spirit.&nbsp; I am well persuaded that no blessings,
excepting these, considered merely in themselves, are worth our
pursuit.&nbsp; Greek, Latin, and Mathematics, are but a poor
portion, if we have nothing more; it is my constant endeavour,
therefore, that these things should sit lightly on my mind, that,
while conscientiously improving every particle of my time, I may
still reserve my heart for God.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The following extract is taken from the first letter of a
correspondence with the writer&rsquo;s endeared friend, <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>which lasted
almost without interruption during a period of twenty years, and,
at distant intervals afterwards, until about two years before his
death.</p>
<h3>TO MR. J. ARMSTRONG.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Chobham House, Jan. 13th, 1807.</p>
<p>My dear Friend,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mr</span>. J. favoured me with a sight of
the letter you wrote to him.&nbsp; It gave me great pleasure to
find you in the first class, and to hear, also, that you are
fagging for your next term; though, blessed be God, human science
is no indispensable requisite, either for salvation or for a
minister of the Gospel, yet it possesses innumerable advantages,
and I doubt not but you will hereafter reap the fruits of your
present exertions.&nbsp; Our greatest fear, my dear Armstrong, is
that we should substitute learning for religion, and lest we
should endeavour to regulate our conduct more by our present
supposed circumstances than by the will of God; but I am
persuaded your fears on this subject are similar to my own, and,
therefore, I need not enlarge.&nbsp; As for myself, when I
sometimes stand still, and consider how ardently I am engaged
about trifles, and, as Young observes,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Wasting my strength in strenuous
idleness,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am quite ashamed, and I go making fresh resolutions of more
devotedness to God and more zeal in his service: but, alas! how
little ground do I gain after all!&nbsp; Assist me with your
prayers, your constant daily prayers; and though we are distant
in place, let us meet one another in spirit.&nbsp; My time of
evening devotion is from six to seven; let us endeavour in
simplicity of heart to meet one another at this time at the
throne of grace; and may God <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>pour on each of us that which will not
only impart a <i>present</i> blessing, but diffuse a sacred tune
of heavenly affection through the <i>residue of our
lives</i>.&nbsp; Our employments necessarily require the exercise
of thought, and very much tend to produce what the Methodists
term &ldquo;distraction;&rdquo; but still the constant influence
of the Divine Spirit, and a continued simplicity of intention,
will enable us to be recollected, even in the midst of our
studies.&nbsp; I was very much pleased lately in reading in the
&ldquo;Epistles of the Apostolic Fathers&rdquo; a passage in one
of St. Ignatius&rsquo; Epistles, somewhat to this effect; he is
giving us some directions for our conduct in life, and adds,
&ldquo;But even the <i>worldly</i> things which <i>ye do</i> are
<i>spiritual</i>, for ye do <i>all things</i> in Jesus
Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; Oh that this may be the temper and spirit of
our lives; may all <i>our worldly things</i> be offered upon this
altar, which sanctifies the gift; and after this transitory scene
of being is ended, may we with pleasure retrace a life entirely
filled with God.&nbsp; I remain, my dear Armstrong,</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Yours, affectionately and
sincerely,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">G. <span
class="smcap">Mortimer</span>.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>He was accustomed to spend his long vacations, during his
residence at Cambridge, with a private tutor, who spent the time
in some salubrious and pleasant part of the country.&nbsp; The
following letter was written on one of those occasions, and is a
proof of his taste for fine scenery, as well as of his great
application to study.</p>
<h3>TO HIS SISTER.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Dawlish, near Exeter, Aug. 12th,
1809.</p>
<p>My dear Sister,</p>
<p>You are, no doubt, returned from Broadstairs, and enjoying the
pleasures arising from quiet and regular <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>movements, and
now and then, perhaps, in the midst of your retirement a thought
wanders towards Devon, and you begin to wonder &ldquo;what has
taken the little fellow that he does not write.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
confess, time has glided on so insensibly, that I was not aware
how long I had been here; I shall really feel sorry to leave my
present situation, for I never spent five weeks so agreeably
before.&nbsp; I lodge with good people, who do all they can to
accommodate me.&nbsp; I make progress in my studies, which is
another source of gratification, and I am situated in the midst
of a country the most diversified and beautiful.&nbsp; As it is
quite new to me, and I may probably never visit it again, I avail
myself of the present opportunity of seeing everything worthy of
notice, and since my purse will not allow me to enjoy any
&ldquo;leathern convenience,&rdquo; I have commenced pedestrian,
and frequently walk from fourteen to eighteen miles a day.&nbsp;
I take a syllabus with me, and go over my subject in my mind, so
that a peep now and then is all I require: by this method I lose
no time, and combine profit with amusement.&nbsp; My stated
walks, however, are much shorter, and devoted to relaxation
only.&nbsp; But there is another source of gratification which I
must mention, and which far exceeds all the rest; it is this, I
feel I am advancing in the best of things; religion has an
increasing and diffusive influence over my mind; it seems more
and more my element, and I am enabled to live in that spirit
which a friend of ours on a late occasion attempted to
ridicule&mdash;I mean a spirit of recollection and prayer; not,
indeed, so much so as I could wish, or as I ought to do, but
still much more so than formerly.&nbsp; When my time for
devotional exercises comes round, it is welcomed as the happiest
of the whole day, and my Sabbaths are days of real pleasure and
permanent good.&nbsp; May such in kind, though greater in degree,
be the happy experience of my dear sister, <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>and may no
studies, no employments whatever, be prosecuted, but in
subordination to those of a spiritual nature.&nbsp; Religion, I
am persuaded, should be everything or nothing; here only a middle
course is dangerous.&nbsp; If we profess to admire and to be
influenced by heavenly objects, we should prize them above
everything; and yet, alas! (O shame to our Christian profession!)
to what poor and paltry considerations are they not daily
sacrificed!&nbsp; Adieu, my dearest sister; may God preserve you
pure and unspotted from the world until the day of his
appearing!</p>
<p>Yours, most affectionately and sincerely,</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Both in Christian and fraternal
bonds,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">G. M.</p>
<h3>TO HIS SISTER.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Cambridge, December, 1809.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Study</span> is, I am persuaded, at
present my duty; but I shall be heartily glad when another year
is over, and I shall be left to pursue the duties of the sacred
office in peace and quietness, if it please God. . . .&nbsp; How
often do I picture to myself these happy scenes, and &ldquo;catch
a momentary joy;&rdquo; but, perhaps, this hand which now glides
swiftly, along the page may soon forget to move.&nbsp; I may be
summoned to another world in the midst of my academical pursuits,
and may never have the honour granted me of building the house of
God.&nbsp; Should this be the case, should your brother be called
to the peaceful tomb before another revolving year, bear in mind,
when he is gone, that his supreme wish has been unfulfilled, and
that his studies and trifling successes have not so filled his
mind as to call it off from the care of souls, and the earnest
wish for their salvation.&nbsp; In this work I would gladly live
<a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>and die;
but the Supreme Disposer of events knows what is best, and in
that I hope, not only to acquiesce, but to rejoice.&nbsp; You
wish for my thoughts on letter-writing.&nbsp; I do not think you
should make two copies of any letters, except it be necessary to
keep one by you for reference; few such circumstances occur, and
therefore I would advise you to write at once what you intend to
send.&nbsp; I do not mean that you should put down whatever comes
into your mind, but write deliberately and with caution.&nbsp; I
would illustrate my meaning by referring to what takes place in
polite conversation; supposing yourself to be in company, and
obliged to converse, you would not weigh and ponder your
sentences over and over, but merely endeavour to avoid anything
indecorous, and to express yourself in tolerably good language;
or, if you will, in the best manner you are able.&nbsp; When you
write, then, you should endeavour to let your thoughts flow
freely and easily, and express them in the most suitable words
which occur at the moment, but by no means to be solicitous in
seeking fine words or eloquent phrases.&nbsp; Horace has a famous
line in his Art of Poetry, which has great strength in the
original, but I must content myself with Francis&rsquo;
translation,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;For if the mind with <i>clear
conceptions</i> glow,<br />
The <i>willing words</i> in just expressions flow.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The substance of what I would say is this, having settled your
subject in your mind, write at once, in the best manner you are
able at the time; practice will give considerable ease, and you
will shortly write, not only well, but with despatch.</p>

REV. JOHN ARMSTRONG.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Queen&rsquo;s, June 24th, 1810.</p>
<p>My very dear Friend,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">You</span> are now, Armstrong, engaged in
an employment to which you have been for years looking forward as
the most pleasing in your life; your ardent spirit could not bear
inactivity in your Master&rsquo;s service, and now your wishes
are granted, and you at last experience the blessedness of
sounding in the ears of a thoughtless and giddy multitude the
glad tidings of reconciliation through the death of our blessed
Redeemer.&nbsp; I need scarcely tell you that you have of late
engrossed many of my thoughts, and been the subject of many of my
prayers.&nbsp; I hope that I feel no <i>common</i> degree of
interest when I hear of any true labourer being called into the
vineyard of our Lord; and shall I be less concerned when one of
the dearest friends I have upon earth is called to a similar
employment?&nbsp; You are <i>entitled</i> to my best of wishes;
you have them freely; and I have no doubt but the blessings of
God will rest upon your labours, and that many in that great and
dreadful day of account&mdash;many will arise from Melchbourn and
Bletsoe, and declare in the ears of an assembled world,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I owe it to his care that I am here,<br />
Next to Almighty grace; his faithful hand,<br />
Regardless of the frowns he might incur,<br />
Snatched me, reluctant, from approaching flames,<br />
Ready to catch and burn unquenchable.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>O my friend, when I think of these inestimable blessings as
connected with the sacred office, I long to lay aside the
drudgery of mathematics; but I <a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>check myself; the future should
employ but little of my thoughts; how to improve the present
should be my principal concern.&nbsp; Much is to be done here as
respects my studies, and much more as to the formation of my
mind, the subjugation of my tempers, and the sanctification of my
heart.&nbsp; I would, therefore, content myself with my present
situation, and endeavour to make it my chief care to prepare for
death and judgment.&nbsp; These awful concerns have, for many
weeks past, engaged my mind more steadily and frequently than for
some years before.&nbsp; I seem to myself as a dying man amidst
dying men, and it is my aim to live accordingly.&nbsp; I have
heard you say, when you were at college, that retirement and your
Bible have afforded you some of the most exalted joys you ever
witnessed; these joys have been lately mine.&nbsp; I go up to my
little room (which I have fitted up and consecrated to sacred
purposes <i>alone</i>), and there I meet my God, find my Saviour
precious, and experience the gracious influence of the blessed
Spirit.&nbsp; When my hours of retirement come round, I joyfully
lay aside everything in which I may be engaged; for I feel, I
know, assuredly and experimentally, that I am going up to commune
with the best, the most gracious and compassionate of
friends.&nbsp; There I leave all my cares and all my sorrows, and
come down again to the concerns of life with an unburdened,
soberized, and tranquil mind.&nbsp; Blessed be God for all his
benefits!&nbsp; I had frequently looked forward to this last year
as the most trying of the three, and had imagined that if I found
it so difficult to keep my ground before, I should necessarily
give way at present; but JEHOVAH has been better to me than my
fears, and I have found the truth of that promise, &ldquo;When
thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and through
the rivers, they shall not overflow thee; when thou walkest
through <a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>the fire, thou shalt not be burnt, neither shall the
flame kindle upon thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Believe me to be,</p>

<h3>TO THE REV. JOHN ARMSTRONG.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Q. C., Camb., Nov. 19th, 1810.</p>
<p>My very dear Friend,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Within</span> a week or two past I have
had to thank my God also for many providential interferences; for
success in our late examinations; for being kept most mercifully
from engaging in something which would have been highly
detrimental to me; for the acquisition of a most valuable
Christian friend (who is a great helper of my faith, and a very
pleasing and agreeable companion; he was, like myself, formerly
engaged in business, and also a Methodist); as also for a
providential opening of my path respecting my future situation in
his church.&nbsp; Of all the places I have yet heard of, this
seems most suited to my views and inclinations.&nbsp; It is, Mr.
Eyton&rsquo;s, of Wellington, Shropshire, six miles from
<i>Madeley</i>, and surrounded by pious ministers.&nbsp; The
vicar is very pious and laborious, of similar sentiments with
myself, humble and affectionate.&nbsp; I know three men in
Cambridge who are very well acquainted with him and his
situation, and they each say that they would go there in
preference to any place whatever.&nbsp; My mother and sister (to
whom I wrote a few days ago concerning him) met him when in
Shropshire; and they advise me by all means to accept of
it.&nbsp; I wrote to him lately, and received an answer, which
has done my heart good.&nbsp; I have not yet finally settled in
my mind, but I shall write either to-day or to-morrow, giving my
final <a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>answer.&nbsp; I hope to be directed from above.&nbsp; I
would not trust my own feelings or inclinations, but in the
all-wise Disposer of events.&nbsp; Pray for me, my dear friend,
that if I should not be useful there, or in any manner out of my
proper place, that something or other may intervene to put a stop
to all further proceedings.&nbsp; I am daily obliged to make some
little preparation for orders, for Mr. E. is in want of
assistance.&nbsp; Should I go to the place, I shall endeavour to
be ordained soon after I take my degree; perhaps in a month or
six weeks, if I can procure a private ordination.&nbsp; My degree
may suffer in some measure, but I cannot help that; we must
expect sometimes to be called to make a little sacrifice, but it
will all be eventually well.</p>
<p>Accept my best wishes</p>
<p style="text-align: center">From your faithful and
affectionate</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span

<h3>TO HIS SISTER.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Q. C. Camb. Jan. 19th, 1811.</p>
<p>My dearest Mary,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My</span> time of anxiety is now
completely over.&nbsp; I have just been admitted B.A., and have
no more college matters to divide my attention, or call off my
thoughts from the grand concern which lays before me.&nbsp; You
will wish to know how I succeeded in my late struggle.&nbsp; I
have no flaming honours to plume myself with, but through the
mercy of God have passed through in such a manner as to afford
cause neither for self-complacency nor discontent.&nbsp; I am a
wrangler, though eleven from the top.&nbsp; My tutors, I am happy
to state, tell me they are quite satisfied with my degree; as it
respects myself, I have not the least wish it were
otherwise.&nbsp; You would find it difficult to enter into my
present feelings.&nbsp; I seem of late to have been like a ship
<a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>tossed and
driven by the fiercest tempests, and in danger every moment of
sinking; but now I have gained the long-looked-for shore, and am
enjoying for a time those sweets which my temporary leisure
affords me.</p>
<h3>TO THE REV. J. ARMSTRONG.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Q. C. Camb. Jan. 19th, 1811.</p>
<p>My dear Armstrong,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Your</span> letter reached me, as you
supposed it would, in the midst of a &ldquo;mighty
contest,&rdquo; and I may congratulate myself upon having fewer
bones broken than I might reasonably have expected.&nbsp; In all
our Lord&rsquo;s dealings with his people, there is the greatest
display of wisdom mixed with loving kindness and mercy; to
satisfy <i>our</i> wishes would frequently be only to administer
poison instead of a balsam, and therefore <i>He</i> prescribes
for us.&nbsp; With these introductory remarks you may perhaps
expect to hear of some considerable disappointment in my place in
the tripos, but this is not the case; I have had every
<i>reasonable</i> expectation answered.&nbsp; I am eleventh
wrangler, and the fifth from the bottom; had I been higher I
might have been vain of my little successes; if lower, I might
have felt depressed and discouraged.&nbsp; As it is, I am not
only contented but happy; I wish I could say as much of another
of the Jerramites, but I am sorry to say I cannot; poor C&mdash;,
though fifth wrangler, feels quite disappointed, and receives the
congratulations of his friends with a very poor grace.&nbsp; Our
good friend Frazer is a man of a different spirit; he is third
senior opt., but is nearly as much pleased with it as any in the
tripos.&nbsp; Johnson is the highest Johnian, who is tenth
wrangler, just one above your humble servant.&nbsp; Dicey, of
Trinity, is thirteenth.&nbsp; The <a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>order of the men you will soon see in
the <i>Christian Observer</i>, and therefore I need not insert
them at large.</p>
<p>I feel quite happy, my dear friend, in having done with every
academical contention.&nbsp; I seem now to have nothing to do but
to improve my mind by the acquisition of useful knowledge, and to
prepare for that most important concern, the sacred
ministry.&nbsp; I take it very kind in your calling my mind to
these things in the midst of my late hurry; we are too apt to be
absorbed with the things of the moment, but through the rich
mercy of God, so great has been my composure for some months
past, that the Senate House and all its appendages ceased to be
objects of terror or solicitude.&nbsp; I may account for this in
a great measure from my having fixed upon the curacy which I
alluded to in my last.&nbsp; The saving of souls seemed more
important than the acquiring of honours; so that my mathematical
studies were entered upon more from a sense of duty than
inclination; but I must not trouble you with these reflections
upon a matter which is now gone by, though gone for ever!</p>
<p>Adieu, my dear friend,</p>
<p style="text-align: center">And believe me to remain,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Your ever faithful<br />
<span class="smcap">George Mortimer</span>.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>As soon as he had passed through the Senate House, and taken
his degree, he was desirous of entering, without delay, upon the
great work which had so long engaged his thoughts; early,
therefore, in the following month he accepted the curacy of
Wellington, in Salop, of which parish the Rev. John Eyton was
vicar; and in a letter to his sister, dated 11th Feb. 1811, after
alluding to the prospect of ordination and of enjoyment with Mr.
Eyton, he says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;My way is now clear, and all I want is
gratitude <a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>to my gracious God for all his past mercies, and a
richer, fuller baptism from above, to qualify me for the
important, solemn duties which will soon engage my
attention.&nbsp; I have been enabled lately to recall some of
those lively feelings which I experienced when I thought of
entering into the ministry; a love for immortal souls, and a
desire to spend and be spent for them in every possible way, in a
more constant feeling of earnest desire than when I was buried
under an enormous load of academical lumber.&nbsp; I suffered
myself to bear it as a mean to an end, but that end being
obtained, I shall dismiss the larger portion for ever; what is
useful I shall retain.&nbsp; However, I am now free from these
incumbrances, and shall hope to improve my liberty by turning the
habits thus acquired to beneficial purposes.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus all seemed in a fair way for his immediate removal to
Wellington, when an unexpected hinderance was put in the way of
his ordination, by the bishop of the diocese.&nbsp; Such
hinderances, in those days, to the dishonour of our Episcopal
Bench, were frequently thrown in the way of men both of
unimpeached character and of sound learning, to whose moral
excellence and literary qualifications their respective colleges
bore ample testimony; but they were men held in suspicion on
account of their great attention to religious duties, and their
warm attachment to the great doctrines of the Reformation: they
were men of scriptural piety, and of sound Church-of-England
principles; but they bore a name of reproach; they were
considered as agitators in the Church, as holding extravagant
views, and as going out of the ordinary path of formality and
heartlessness, which characterized the great body of the Church
in those days.&nbsp; Happily, such prejudices have, in a great
measure, passed away, and no such obstacles exist to the
ordination or preferment of men <a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>of such views and principles; not
that such men are altogether exempt from slight and neglect, from
discouragement and opposition, on the part of many of the rulers
in the Church at this day; but they are now constrained by the
weight of their character, by their well-known laborious habits
in their pastoral duties, as well as by their wealth, their
influence, and their number, to pay them some respect and
attention; and, blessed be God! there are many of our
ecclesiastical governors who now know the worth of such men, and
who afford them all suitable encouragement and support.</p>
<p>Mr. Mortimer deeply felt this disappointment; but that God was
pleased to make it the means of calling forth the exercise of his
Christian grace, may be seen by the three following
letters:&mdash;</p>
<h3>TO HIS SISTER.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">With</span> a mind willing to acquiesce in
whatever my God shall appoint, I am enabled to leave this and all
my concerns to his gracious disposal, being fully persuaded that
the Lord reigneth.&nbsp; If I have at all profited by past
experience in anything, it is in this, a strong and operative
conviction that so long as we trust in God, our concerns, however
unpleasant at the time, will materially conduce to our welfare;
and oh! what an intolerable load of foolish anxiety and trouble
does this persuasion remove from our labouring minds!&nbsp; You
will perhaps remember that one of the last topics of
conversation, when you and Eliza so kindly accompanied me to the
Wash, was the necessity of sacrificing our own will to others, if
we would enjoy comfort ourselves.&nbsp; I was naturally led to
speculate on the future, but could not help being forcibly struck
with the mighty efficacy of this principle, if suffered to
operate freely on our conduct.</p>
<p><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>As I
think it very probable my continuance in college may be
prolonged, I intend availing myself of the opportunity thus
afforded me of attending a course of lectures on anatomy,
chemistry and mineralogy.&nbsp; When I thought it my duty to ask
for orders in March, I willingly gave up all thought of enjoying
this gratification.&nbsp; I was enabled to sacrifice it to more
important considerations, but since these reasons no longer
exist, I shall gladly avail myself of the privilege.</p>
<p>Upon the subject of <i>general</i> knowledge for a minister, I
was much pleased with Herbert&rsquo;s &ldquo;Priest to the
Temple.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The country parson is full of all
knowledge: they say, that it is an ill mason that refuseth any
stone, and there is no knowledge but serves either positively as
it is, or else to illustrate some other knowledge: he condescends
even to the knowledge of tillage and pasturage, and makes great
use of them in teaching, because people by what they understand
are best led to what they understand not.&rdquo;&nbsp; As one
means of preparing me for the great charge which lies before me,
I have begun a regular course of the lives of eminently pious
characters.&nbsp; The good I received from this kind of reading
some years ago, makes me indulge the hope that it may be equally
serviceable now; but I would not rest here&mdash;it is a real
baptism of the Holy Spirit alone which can properly qualify me
for usefulness in the pulpit, and a consistent course out of
it.</p>
<h3>TO THE REV. J. ARMSTRONG.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Q. C. Camb. Feb. 26, 1811.</p>
<p>My very dear Friend,</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * * * *</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Since</span> I last wrote to you I have
been spending a <a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>few days at Islington; but my stay being very short, I
was obliged to confine myself wholly to home.&nbsp; I visited but
one person all this time.&nbsp; I had hoped, however, to have
returned again soon, and to have done myself the pleasure of
calling on my several friends; but a very unpleasant circumstance
has hindered me&mdash;the bishop has refused me ordination at
present: and I am under the necessity of waiting till it shall
please my gracious God to show my path.&nbsp; My vicar is a
<i>notorious</i> character, and my friends have all along been
apprehensive lest I should find some difficulty in getting
ordained to his curacy.&nbsp; I must say, I shall not be a little
disappointed should I be obliged to relinquish all thought of
Wellington; but the matter is in the Lord&rsquo;s hands, and I
would willingly leave it to his all-wise disposal.&nbsp; If I
have learned anything by my past experience, it is this, to feel
fully persuaded that all our concerns, however unpleasant they
may be at the present, will, either in this world or in the world
to come, terminate in our good.&nbsp; In affairs of this kind it
is better to make as little fuss as possible: I must therefore
beg you will not mention it to any one.&nbsp; I shall wait
quietly for the present, in hope that the bishop may relent; but
should not this be the case, I must content myself with some
other situation.&nbsp; Poor G. is similarly circumstanced with
myself; he has been refused <i>three</i> times, and that, too, in
spite of the interest of the Master; he wishes to be ordained on
his Coll. Fellowship, and that lover of the truth, the good
Bishop of Ely, has every time put a spoke in his wheel.&nbsp; But
what a mercy it is that, notwithstanding all the opposition which
serious candidates meet with, still they are not, cannot be,
entirely hindered and excluded! * * * * * *</p>
<p>And believe me to remain,</p>

<h3><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>TO HIS
SISTER.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Cambridge, March 2, 1811.</p>
<p>I <span class="smcap">had</span> imagined, some months ago,
that the exercise of mind I was under when preparing for the
Senate House, was the greatest I should ever experience; I was
greatly mistaken.&nbsp; O my sister, did you know how much I have
felt lately, you would truly sympathise with me; but I now enjoy
comparative rest; my feelings, indeed, have been strongly mixed,
but the better have generally, though not without considerable
struggle, predominated.&nbsp; I have enjoyed more of the power of
vital religion, and that has been my support and stay; and would
it but please my God to indulge me with more communion with
himself, <span class="smcap">He</span> might do with me and my
poor concerns whatever might please <span
class="smcap">Him</span>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">He</span>
alone is truly and absolutely necessary for my comfort, and would
<span class="smcap">He</span> but say, in my subsequent career,
&ldquo;My presence shall go with thee,&rdquo; I should feel that
enough.&nbsp; I could ask nothing more.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The clouds which overcast his prospect of ordination for the
curacy of Wellington, were after a time dispersed, and he was
admitted to deacon&rsquo;s orders at Eccleshall, on the 26th of
May, 1811, and on the following day he went to reside at
Wellington.&nbsp; He not long after wrote to his sister, in
reference to his new situation, as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Through mercy I am going on pretty
comfortably in parochial matters, and have reason to believe I am
in the situation which God designed me to fill.&nbsp; My
employment is my delight&mdash;my heart is in it&mdash;a
circumstance I could seldom boast of when toiling through the
drudgery of mathematics.&nbsp; Mr. E. and <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>I go on in
perfect harmony.&nbsp; I feel very much attached to him; and from
the marks I am daily receiving of his kindness, I may conclude he
looks with a favourable eye on my endeavours to help him in his
important work.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>TO HIS SISTER.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Wellington, 12th November, 1811.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> my last I promised an account of
my parochial proceedings: though I have nothing brilliant to
communicate, yet I hope I may say, after nearly six months&rsquo;
residence, that I have good ground to believe I have not mistaken
my path in entering the ministry.&nbsp; The increase of
congregation, both among the poorer as well as the richer sort,
afford me some encouragement, and I have frequently observed
persons manifestly affected under the word delivered.&nbsp; I am
not so sanguine as to expect great things should be done by so
feeble a labourer as myself.&nbsp; &ldquo;The honest and good
hearted&rdquo; among the congregation have already gladly
received and profited by the word under my most excellent vicar,
and, consequently, it is not to be expected that any remarkable
change should be effected; but, as I have observed before, I have
perceived that the Spirit of God is among us to apply the word,
and so long as persons are not completely hardened, we may
indulge some hope concerning them.</p>
<p>A few Sundays ago I supplied the church of a neighbouring
minister who has not been long in these parts.&nbsp; I preached
from these words, &ldquo;The Lord turned and looked on
Peter.&rdquo;&nbsp; I had taken another sermon with me, but some
how or other could not make up my mind to preach it, and it will
appear by the sequel that the Lord had some gracious purpose <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>to answer by
it.&nbsp; A poor woman, a former hearer of Mr. &mdash; happened
to come into this part of the country, and she mentioned to her
daughter that she should like to go and hear her old minister,
but related at the same time a dream that she had the night
before, that a strange minister at Mr. C&mdash;&rsquo;s church
was the means of doing her good and recovering her from her
backsliding state.&nbsp; She accordingly came, and no sooner did
I enter the desk than she said to her daughter, &ldquo;That is
the clergyman I dreamed of who recovered me to God.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The subject by the Divine blessing was suitable to her case, and
Mr. &mdash;, who related the anecdote to me, stated, that she
began with fresh earnestness to devote herself to the service of
God, and gave manifest tokens of the work being from above.</p>
<h3>TO THE REV. J. ARMSTRONG.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Wellington, September 17th,
1811.</p>
<p>My very dear Armstrong,</p>
<p>I <span class="smcap">have</span> been regaling myself this
afternoon with a perusal of a large packet of your letters,
forwarded to me from time to time.&nbsp; They present my much
esteemed friend under a great variety of feelings and
circumstances: but they uniformly exhibit him as the sincere and
devoted Christian, and as the warm and substantial friend.&nbsp;
Oh, how do I pity that poor soul who has never experienced the
exquisite delights of friendship!&nbsp; Believe me, Armstrong, I
would not exchange the feelings which at present animate my soul
for all the wealth in the universe.&nbsp; It would be bauble when
contrasted with the inestimable blessing of a friend, whose
heart, whose sentiments, whose pursuits, are congenial with your
own.&nbsp; God forbid that I should ever see the time in which
this blessing <a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>should he withholden from me.&nbsp; How do I admire
those words of Shakspeare:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The friends thou hast, <i>and their
adoption tried</i>,<br />
<i>Grapple</i> them to thy soul with hooks of steel.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I lament, however, one circumstance in which my sentiments and
my conduct were in this respect diametrically opposite; I mean
when I so far gave way to the feelings of the moment as to write
that letter, which seems to have caused you so much pain: your
conciliatory answer, which I have just been reading, makes me
more ashamed of myself than I can express; I hope, however, that
it will prove a salutary warning through the whole of my
subsequent life.&nbsp; You will be surprised, perhaps, at this
apology made so long after the offence: I make it from a
conviction that my former letter did not sufficiently express the
feelings which I ought to have entertained. * * * * *</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Believe me,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Your affectionately sincere<br />
G. M.</p>
<h3>TO THE REV. J. ARMSTRONG.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Wellington, Jan. 28th, 1812.</p>
<p>My very dear Friend,</p>
<p>I <span class="smcap">very</span> much long to see you and
your little domestic circle, and, especially so, in consequence
of the information contained in your last: for I am given to
understand that personal intercourse will not much longer be
vouchsafed me.</p>
<p>Do not suppose, however, that I would wish that any personal
advantage, which I might promise myself from your remaining in
England, should prove the <a name="page25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>least obstacle to that most glorious
work which it has pleased God to incline you to desire and
pursue.&nbsp; I rejoice most sincerely in the grace which he has
poured upon you, and I admire the leadings of Divine Providence,
which have so clearly and manifestly opened your path.&nbsp; But
still, notwithstanding the approval which my judgment is
constrained to give, yet I cannot altogether divest myself of
that affection which would fain induce me to chain you to some
nearer spot.&nbsp; It tells me that <i>real</i> friends are few;
it whispers also that, among all my friends, no one has ever yet
so completely merited the name.&nbsp; But still, as it has
pleased God to put it into the heart of my friend to undertake so
noble, so glorious an employment, I cannot for a moment indulge
any feeling of complaint.&nbsp; It is all well; and, as I said
before, I rejoice in the grace and providential dealings which
have been manifested on your behalf.</p>
<p>It requires no small measure of <i>faith</i> and
<i>self-denial</i> to leave the pleasures of social
life&mdash;the intercourse of friends and the innumerable ties
which a long series of years has tended to strengthen.&nbsp; I
have often gazed in silent admiration at the peculiar kind of
spirit which must animate a missionary, and have concluded that
it must be peculiarly acceptable in the sight of Almighty
God.&nbsp; But, alas! much as I have admired the spirit, I feel
that I have scarcely a spark of it&mdash;not, indeed, that I
should find it difficult to forego the pleasures which at present
surround me, not that I should be staggered at leaving my present
situation to live in one which is remote, and which is now
unknown to me; but that I am sensible that <i>these feelings
would not last</i>.&nbsp; The inconceivable ignorance of some,
the stupidity of others, and the state (I was going to say) of
<i>moral and religious incapacity</i>, to which a long indulgence
in vicious habits has reduced the generality, would check my
fervour, damp my zeal, and cause me either to slacken my <a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>exertions, or
else to desist from the work in despair.&nbsp; When we get into
discouraging circumstances, how readily do we slide into
despondency.&nbsp; We may not, perhaps, altogether lose sight of
the power of God, and its all-sufficiency to help us through; but
we are apt to conclude that we are not the proper instruments;
that we have protruded ourselves into situations which God never
designed for us; and that, though he <i>could</i> most easily
help us, yet that, for wise purposes, he sees fit to leave us in
a great measure to ourselves.&nbsp; Such, my dear Armstrong, are
our reasonings in general, when brought into discouraging
circumstances; and, from a close examination of my own heart for
some years past, I am persuaded that whatever zeal and
self-denial might animate me in the first instance, yet that
these blessed feelings would not last when brought to those
severe trials which are the lot of the <i>missionary</i>&mdash;I
mean of that person who has to contend with all the difficulties
arising from a foreign station.&nbsp; These difficulties,
however, in your case are greatly diminished, and even were it
otherwise the Spirit vouchsafed to you, may enable you to grapple
with them with the greatest ease.&nbsp; Oh! that this may be your
constant experience!&nbsp; I rejoice in that spirit and temper
which has hitherto regulated the conduct of my friend, and my
constant, my stated prayers shall ascend up before the God of
power and grace, that he may ever enjoy a rich unction&mdash;a
complete baptism from above.</p>
<p>Assure Mrs. A. of my kind regards.&nbsp; Much as I admire
<i>your</i> faith and self-denial, I think that of your dear
partner no less conspicuous.&nbsp; When God has work to be done,
how sweetly can he influence our minds so as to make us
co-workers with himself.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>Mr.
Mortimer was married February 21st, 1812, to Miss Barford, a lady
of pious habits and of amiable manners, and who proved herself a
most useful and affectionate helpmeet to him.&nbsp; In the view
of this event, he prepared, some months before it took place, the
following resolutions for his government in the married
state:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Since it is very probable I shall soon be
united with my dearest friend M. B., and since we are always in
danger of overlooking the duties of each relation in life, while
engaged in it, though, before we enter upon it, we may perceive
them plainly enough, I would, therefore, now, in an humble
dependence upon Almighty God, and as in his sight, set my hand to
the following resolutions, which I would purpose never to swerve
from upon any occasion, let it be ever so trivial:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;1st.&nbsp; Since the grand secret of domestic comfort
depends upon the <i>regulation of our tempers</i>, I would, in
the first place, endeavour to keep a strict watch over these;
would avoid <i>pettishness</i>, of every description, and would
guard against a degree of <i>pertinacity</i>, which has always
been more or less troublesome to me: would never be <i>positive
in argument</i>, and will strive to remove every appearance of
<i>self-will</i>, and never to oppose my dearest friend in
<i>any</i> thing, excepting when duty <i>imperiously calls</i>;
and even then, in such a manner as shall impress her more with an
idea of my affectionate regards towards her, than of any wish to
consult my own gratification.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the 2nd place: will cultivate a <i>tender</i> and
<i>affectionate</i> manner, always seeking out means of promoting
her comfort, and lessening her troubles; sharing every
<i>domestic</i> and <i>maternal</i> anxiety with <i>tender
solicitude</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the 3rd place: will be completely <i>open</i>; will
have no secrets; on the contrary, will consult her in everything;
will give her the freest access to all <a name="page28"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>my papers, letters, &amp;c.; will
also commit to her entire management all my money concerns; and
will take no more for my private purse than we shall amicably
settle between ourselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fourthly.&nbsp; With regard to <i>company</i>, will
make choice of those persons who shall be most agreeable to
herself, and will be very attentive to those of her relations
with whom she may wish to be connected&mdash;especially her
mother and sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fifthly.&nbsp; Being aware of the foolish trouble
occasioned by fastidiousness in the <i>choice of food</i>, am
determined never to express my partiality for any particular
joint or dish, and never to make the smallest objection to
anything which comes to table.&nbsp; Remember Duke Fortunatus,
and the incessant squabbles occasioned by his fluctuating taste
and pettish tempers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So lastly.&nbsp; As to the arrangement of <i>domestic
concerns</i>, will interfere as little as need be, and will never
meddle either in the choice or dismissal of the servants, and
will be careful never to find with them unnecessary fault.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These rules and regulations I will read over the first
day of every month, so long as it shall please God to spare me,
and will make them matter of most serious prayer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Should I see fit to make any additions to the above,
will still never destroy <i>this</i> identical paper, but keep it
as exhibiting my views previous to marriage, and as a witness
against me in future life, should I deliberately violate
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I write these rules in my college rooms on the 20th of
May, 1811, being the day on which I complete the 27th year of my
age, and being also the last of my remaining in Cambridge.</p>

<h3><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>TO THE
REV. J. ARMSTRONG.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Wellington, April 10th, 1812.</p>
<p>My very dear Friend,</p>
<p>I <span class="smcap">cannot</span> describe the feeling of
regret which the receipt of your last letter occasioned, and I
sit down, with depressed spirits, to dictate an answer.&nbsp;
There is something exceedingly gloomy in the recollection that
one of the dearest friends I have on earth, is about to depart to
a place where there is no human probability of our ever meeting;
and that he should depart also without my being permitted to look
him in the face, to clasp his hand, and to bid him a parting
adieu.&nbsp; I feel truly grieved at the circumstance, and the
more so, as I had expected that you would have been detained on
shore longer than the time fixed on for your departure, and
consequently that you would have had some little spare time to
pay us a farewell visit.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * * *</p>
<p>I feel comforted, however, with the hope of hearing from you
occasionally, and do give you my promise that I will endeavour to
write to you <i>every other month</i>, whether I hear from you or
not; and my poor scrawls shall be duly forwarded to your good
brother, as you have desired.&nbsp; I will inform you of our
proceedings here as minutely as I can; and will take care to
touch upon such of a more public nature as I conceive may
possibly escape the attention of your other correspondents.&nbsp;
But while I am thus writing, I cannot conceal from my Armstrong
what has recently passed in my mind.&nbsp; I have long thought it
to be a circumstance highly disgraceful to our Church that so few
individuals have appeared who <a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>are willing to leave the comforts of
life, and to endeavour to forward, by their own exertions, the
grand and momentous work which the God of all grace is evidently
carrying forward in all quarters of the globe; and I now begin to
feel a desire (should the providence of God be pleased to open my
path), to step forward in this great work.&nbsp; I have opened
the matter to my Mary, and she tells me that she is willing to
accompany me to any place where I should see it my duty to
go.&nbsp; It has pleased God to give us a competency as to this
world&rsquo;s goods, and should any situation similar to the one
you are going to, occur, we should really feel no hesitation in
accepting it.&nbsp; What our future path may be is uncertain; but
I should not wonder if my dear Armstrong hears of our following
in the steps which he has marked out for us.&nbsp; There seems
much to be done abroad, and few inclined to do it; should,
therefore, God be pleased to accept of my poor intentions to be
engaged in forwarding it, I shall rejoice in the circumstance,
and gladly spend and be spent in so glorious an employment.&nbsp;
I have said to my Armstrong what has been mentioned to no other
individual whatever, my Mary excepted; I must therefore request
he will not make the slightest allusion to it for the
present.</p>
<p>I have taken the liberty to send you and Mrs. A. a small token
of parting love; may they prove the means of your frequently
remembering the unworthy donor, and whenever you think of him
offer up a silent prayer for his spiritual advancement.&nbsp; I
have also to request that you will accept of the enclosed notes;
<a name="citation30"></a><a href="#footnote30"
class="citation">[30]</a> they may, perhaps, prove serviceable in
procuring a few more additional comforts for your voyage and
future accommodations.&nbsp; May the God of love accompany you in
your voyage, make <a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>you abundantly useful in your passage, and still more so
in your destined situation.&nbsp; My prayers, my best wishes, do
certainly attend you; and though we may not meet on earth, yet I
hope&mdash;I would I could say more, but my treacherous heart
will not permit me&mdash;but still I hope that you and I, our
partners, and the children whom God may graciously give us, may
all meet in that blissful state above.&nbsp; My Mary desires her
kindest regards to Mrs. A. and yourself.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Believe me,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Your ever affectionate Friend,<br />
G. M.</p>
<h3>TO THE REV. J. ARMSTRONG.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Wellington, July 6th, 1812.</p>
<p>My dear Friend,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">As</span> it respects myself, I must say
that I feel the comparatively trifling duties which I have to
perform to be a burden, which at times seems insupportable; but
it is the burden which God has placed upon me, and, therefore, I
strive to go on and to press forward, notwithstanding all my
difficulties.&nbsp; You would hardly conceive how much I dread
any public exercise until the moment in which I am actually
engaged in it; I am filled with the most dismal forebodings; but
then, through mercy all my fears vanish; and I have reason to
believe, that my feeble efforts are not altogether in vain.</p>
<p>Nothing further has elapsed respecting any change in my
situation.&nbsp; My Mary feels a good many apprehensions on the
subject at present, and I believe I must leave matters till some
circumstance or other makes my way clear and evident.&nbsp;
<i>Our</i> time is very seldom <i>God&rsquo;s</i>.&nbsp; There is
a haste&mdash;a precipitancy&mdash;in our proceedings, which is
never to be discovered in <a name="page32"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>those of God.&nbsp; The creation of
the world&mdash;the calling of his peculiar people&mdash;the
coming of the Messiah&mdash;all show that God is slow in
operation.&nbsp; I feel, my dear friend, that I have daily and
hourly need of learning a lesson on this subject.&nbsp; Whenever
I feel hurry of spirits, and solicited to do something or other
in haste, I invariably find that it turns out badly.&nbsp; It is
the power of the enemy&mdash;God&rsquo;s procedure is
orderly&mdash;calm&mdash;deliberate: he leads us gently on, and,
while he forcibly convinces the mind, he opens our providential
path.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * * * *</p>
<p>We live in troublesome times, in a troublesome world.&nbsp;
But still we have much to be thankful for, notwithstanding all,
and we have a blessed hope of things infinitely better in the
world to come.&nbsp; I delight to think of those blessed scenes,
and am persuaded that we all of us lose much for want of
reverting to them more frequently.&nbsp; With heaven in our eye,
how cheerfully are we enabled to march forward; how courageously
do we charge through all opposing difficulties; how
contemptuously do we look upon the things of time and
sense!&nbsp; Here was the grand support of the Redeemer;
&ldquo;<i>For the joy which was set before him</i> he endured the
cross, and <i>despised</i> the shame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have lately been very much gratified by reading a piece of
Dr. Watts&rsquo; on the Separate State.&nbsp; We are apt to form
too spiritual notions of the world to come, and, consequently,
having nothing upon which we can solidly ground our
investigations, we lose much of the interest and delight which
would otherwise be imparted.&nbsp; When the <i>literal</i>
meaning of Scripture seems to be absurd, we think we are fully
justified in seeking other interpretations; but to reject the
plain and obvious sense merely because it interferes with our
pre-conceived notions of the subject, is, in my opinion, quite
unwarrantable.&nbsp; We read of <i>cities</i>, <a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span><i>temples</i>, <i>altars</i>, <i>mansions</i>,
<i>feasts</i>, <i>trees</i>, and <i>rivers</i>.&nbsp; And no
doubt but many of our enjoyments will be exceedingly similar to
those which <i>Adam</i> enjoyed on earth, when in a state of
innocence; and it is very probable that the employments which
<i>engage us now</i> will <i>fit us</i> for similar
<i>hereafter</i>.&nbsp; All our peculiarities of mind and
disposition will have room for their full exercise: the traveller
may be permitted to take excursions into distant worlds.&nbsp;
The <i>philosopher</i> may pursue, without limitation, the
investigations of science and of art.&nbsp; <i>The soul which is
enchanted with</i> harmony, may, like David, be the leader of
some celestial band; and the <i>divine</i> will be delighted with
fresh discoveries into the nature, the attributes, the
perfections, of his God; while the other myriads of beings, each
in their proper class and society, will be enjoying to the utmost
of their capacity the blessings which are most calculated to
administer to their delight.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * *</p>
<p style="text-align: right">From your sincere Friend,<br />
G. M.</p>
<h3>TO A YOUNG LADY.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Wellington, August 13th, 1812.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">You</span> have my condolence, my dear
Miss &mdash; in not being able to attend the kind of ministry you
approve of.&nbsp; Most individuals have a turn of mind, a
peculiarity of thinking, which, in a great measure, may be
considered as their own; and hence it should seem advisable that
when the choice rests on ourselves, we should attend that
ministry which comes nearest to our own case and
circumstances.&nbsp; But, alas! this privilege is seldom allotted
us; local situation, parental restraints, and a variety of other
things, render it in general necessary to attend some place <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>or other,
which is not, perhaps, in every view, that which, if left to
ourselves, we would have fixed upon.&nbsp; The question, then, is
merely this&mdash;ought we, under the circumstances, to quarrel
with the dispensations of providence, or quietly and patiently
submit, endeavouring to extract from existing circumstances all
the good we possibly can?&nbsp; The language of wisdom, as well
as of piety, seems to direct to the latter course, as that best
calculated to promote our present comfort, and future
welfare.&nbsp; God has certainly some wise end or other to answer
in every thing of this nature, and if we recollect, at the same
time, how tenderly he loves us, how much he desires our spiritual
improvement, as well as our eternal felicity, we shall rest so
completely satisfied that we shall not have a single desire to
alter in the minutest particular.&nbsp; But we are too apt to
lose sight of the wisdom and love of God, as connected with our
affairs, we listen to the suggestions of Satan, and fondly
imagine that if we had the disposal of things we could easily
regulate our concerns, so as to make them more effectually
conduce to our welfare.&nbsp; How presumptuous is such language,
when stripped of its false colouring, and presented under its
real and proper appearance.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>On the 30th November, 1812, he writes to his sister&mdash;I
think that I mentioned in my last that there was an increase of
congregation, and that I could discover some traces of the
operation of the Spirit of God in applying the word.&nbsp; These
effects, I gratefully acknowledge, are still to be seen, and it
has pleased God to encourage me by bringing to my knowledge two
instances in which I hope a decided and saving change has been
produced&mdash;one on a lady of respectability in an adjoining
parish, and the other on an individual among the lower
circles.</p>
<p>On the 11th January, 1813, he writes to the same, on the birth
of his eldest son;&mdash;I feel grateful to God for his goodness
and mercy, as manifested on <a name="page35"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 35</span>the present occasion, and I am
cheered with a pleasing hope that the deposit which has this day
been placed in my hands, will become an heir of immortality, a
glory to his God, and an instrument of good to all around
him.&nbsp; He has been the subject of my prayers for some time
past, and I feel persuaded that God will not disappoint my
hope.&nbsp; I, and its dear mother, feel anxious on its account,
but what is our solicitude concerning him compared with that of
the dear Redeemer!&nbsp; How kindly is he interested in his
welfare; how ardently does <i>he</i> long to see in him of the
travail of his soul that he may be satisfied!&nbsp; What
encouragement does this consideration afford to the exercise of
patient hope and persevering prayer.</p>
<p>And on the 24th of the following month, he wrote in reference
to the baptism of the infant.&nbsp; We hope, should all be well,
on this day se&rsquo;nnight, to devote our little charge to his
gracious God in baptism.&nbsp; I feel it to be a solemn occasion,
for I cannot but think that much, both of its future happiness
and usefulness, may depend on the manner in which it is thus
surrendered.&nbsp; I am somewhat apprehensive that we shall not
quite please you with respect to the name which we think of
giving it.&nbsp; But it has long struck me as being a foolish
custom which prevails at present of giving those names by way of
distinction, which, in fact, owing to their commonness, are no
distinction at all.&nbsp; George, Thomas, Henry, John, are used
from generation to generation, and thus individuals are
incessantly mistaken and confounded either for other.&nbsp; We
have, therefore, ventured to step out of the beaten track, and
have accordingly fixed upon Cecil, as one which, from many
pleasing associations, has become endeared to both of us.</p>
<h3><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>TO HIS
SISTER.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Wellington, March 16th, 1813.</p>
<p>I have enclosed a copy of a new edition of <i>Alleine&rsquo;s
Alarm</i>, published by Mr. Gilpin.&nbsp; It was this book, to
which, under God, I feel indebted for the determination which
some years ago I received, with respect to my views and
conduct.&nbsp; I love it greatly in its old and less inviting
garb, but far better now.&nbsp; Ah, my dear sister, many profess
religion, many enjoy some of its comforts, feel pleasure in an
attendance upon its institutions and its ordinances; but, to walk
closely with God, to get a deep and thorough knowledge both of
him and of our own souls, to penetrate beneath the surface of
religion and to forward the life&mdash;the inward life of God in
the soul, something more is required.&nbsp; In order to this, our
eye must be kept constantly directed to one and the same point;
we must learn that one thing is supereminently needful, and that
everything which stands in competition with it must be considered
as dung and as dross.&nbsp; May God in mercy impart to both of us
such clear, such vivid and luminous views of its importance, that
the present world and all its gaudy trifles may be lessened in
our estimation, and that true and vital godliness, deep and
genuine spirituality, may become more and more the objects of our
pursuits.&nbsp; We were yesterday with dear Mrs. Fletcher, and
received, as usual, much profit from her choice, savoury, and
spiritual remarks.&nbsp; The book, which lay open before her, was
her Bible.&nbsp; I could not help thinking how much more
efficaciously we should all of us proceed, both as ministers and
private Christians, if this blessed book were more frequently and
more seriously perused.&nbsp; There is a strange feeling with
respect to it existing in the minds of most persons who may be <a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>considered as
even pious characters.&nbsp; They would not feel happy if they
suffered the day to pass over without reading their chapter or
chapters, but still they do it as a duty, merely as a duty.&nbsp;
How rarely is it taken up as a privilege, as the book of books,
as the very choicest treasure which we could possibly open; and
yet, unless it be thus resorted to, thus feelingly read and
studied, how can we expect to be great proficients in the Divine
Life&mdash;how can we drink deep into the Spirit of our
God?&nbsp; Could we see into the manner in which many individuals
perform the duties of their closet, we should not be much at a
loss to discover the reason of their want of spirituality.&nbsp;
It might all be easily and naturally traced to this one single
source&mdash;their hour thus set apart is gone through in a
manner not very dissimilar to a horse in a mill; they go round
and round with the same lifeless formality; and when their duty
is over, they pass with unaltered uninfluenced feelings to
anything which may next engage their attention; but how different
from those who walk in their solitude with God; who go to their
closets as if they were about to meet the very best friend they
have upon earth; who feel heavenly emotions on every such
occasion rekindled; whose hearts are made to burn within them; in
short, who so wait upon God as to renew their strength; who carry
from their privacy a holy influence which is easily discovered in
the whole of their converse, tempers, and pursuits.&nbsp; Give
our kind love to Eliza, and accept the same yourself.&nbsp; To
both of you we feel no small degree of affectionate regards; we
often talk of you, but still oftener make you the subject of our
thoughts.</p>
<h3><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>TO THE
REV. J. ARMSTRONG.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Wellington, April, 1813.</p>
<p>My dear Friend,</p>
<p>I <span class="smcap">have</span> of late been obliged to give
up all thoughts of missionary exertions; my <i>present</i>
ministerial labours (small, alas! as they are when contrasted
with the more extended operations of my dear friend) are a weight
which presses very heavily upon my mind; they drink up all my
spirits, and have so completely transformed me from the cheerful
happy individual which I formerly used to be, that could you
break in upon me accidentally and unawares you would hardly
recognise me for the same.&nbsp; Ah, my dear friend, could I have
foreseen these things, I should scarcely have dared to have
encountered all the anxieties and perplexities attendant upon the
ministerial office.&nbsp; I feel indeed that I have to sustain a
burden; but there is one cheering consideration&mdash;it is the
Lord&rsquo;s burden; it is placed and appointed by him, and if
patiently sustained, not only his glory, but my own eternal
welfare, and perhaps that of others also, will be advanced.&nbsp;
But if I feel the burden so great at present, how little am I cut
out for so great a work as that which you have the honour and the
privilege to be employed in!</p>
<p>In the service of the sanctuary there were hewers of wood and
drawers of water.&nbsp; I seem to be of this description.&nbsp;
But, though these individuals were mean and insignificant,
compared with others, yet were they useful in their way; and, if
God do but bless my labours, I trust I shall be content and be
willing to be employed by him to the end of my days.&nbsp; I
would gratefully acknowledge some of his gracious manifestations
in this respect.&nbsp; Two individuals have, I trust, been
savingly brought to the knowledge of <a name="page39"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 39</span>God, and some few have, in other
respects, been benefited.&nbsp; This is the Lord&rsquo;s doing,
and it is marvellous in our eyes.</p>
<p>But though my ministerial duties are thus oppressive, I have
reason to be thankful in other respects.&nbsp; I have a dear
wife, whom I tenderly love, and God has been pleased to present
me, about three months since, with a sweet and interesting little
son.&nbsp; He is healthy, animated, and vigorous, and proves to
me a source of comfort which, I must frankly confess, I but
little anticipated.&nbsp; I feel I have an important deposit
placed within my hands; but I trust God will enable me to train
him for the skies, and then all will be well.&nbsp; We have named
him &ldquo;Cecil,&rdquo; after our trusty, excellent, and most
valuable friend.&nbsp; I should have preferred to have prefixed
in its stead that of my good friend whom I am addressing; but its
length, as well as the number of consonants which compose it,
render it as a Christian name somewhat harsh and sonorous.</p>
<p>Since I last wrote to you, I received a letter from our friend
F&mdash;, of Trinity.&nbsp; It was the bearer of melancholy
tidings; the cup of this excellent young man seems to be composed
of sorrows peculiarly severe.&nbsp; He lost some time ago, as you
will doubtless recollect, a tender father, under circumstances
truly afflictive, and now he has lost his still dearer
mother.</p>
<p>He heard, by letter, of her illness, rode to Inverness, where
she then was, without the least intermission; but when he
arrived, she was dead.&nbsp; The weight of this calamity upon his
mind, together with the accumulated pressure of temporal and
domestic concerns, have caused him to pass through deep waters;
but God has given to them a sanctifying influence: you would be
truly gratified at the genuine stream of piety which pervades the
whole of his letter.&nbsp; It characterizes a real child of
God.</p>
<p><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>I have
lately been turning my attention towards botany.&nbsp; Should you
ever be sending a packet to your brother, would you be so kind as
to enclose me a few seeds of some of your choice and beautiful
flowers; I mean those which are peculiar to your climate?&nbsp;
You will favour me still further by affixing the names by which
they are commonly known.&nbsp; If you have never amused yourself
in this way, you will be surprised at the inexhaustible source of
pleasure of which it is capable.&nbsp; I walked out with my Mary
this morning through the adjoining country.&nbsp; We were pleased
and exhilarated on various accounts; but our botanic pleasures
were by far the greatest.&nbsp; Little, exquisitely tasty
beauties were discovered by us, which before had completely
escaped our notice; they lie before me on my table; and while I
look at them, I am led to adore the Hand which so elegantly and
ingeniously formed them.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * * *</p>
<p>My best wishes and my constant <i>weekly</i> prayers attend
you.&nbsp; I greatly love you&mdash;am tenderly concerned in your
welfare, and shall always rejoice on being able to congratulate
you on its realization.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">From your ever sincere Friend,<br />

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>About the middle of the year 1814, Mr. Mortimer was joined by
a coadjutor in the curacy of Wellington, of a kindred spirit with
himself, and one with whom he seems to have taken sweet counsel,
walking to the house and service of God as friends.&nbsp; This
was the Rev. John King, already mentioned in the preface.&nbsp;
In a letter to his sister, on the 3rd of June, 1814, is this
short notice of the event just referred to:&mdash;&ldquo;My dear
friend King has joined us&mdash;he is beloved by
all.&rdquo;&nbsp; In another letter dated the 30th of the same
month, he mentions his great attachment <a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>to Mr. King,
their delightful opportunities of studying together, and that he
esteems his coming under his roof as one of the greatest
blessings ever vouchsafed.&nbsp; His intimacy with this gentleman
was formed at the University; &ldquo;being introduced to
him,&rdquo; as he mentions in a letter to the writer, &ldquo;the
very first evening of his coming to college, and we have,&rdquo;
he adds, &ldquo;ever since remained in the closest bonds of
union.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>TO THE REV. J. ARMSTRONG.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Wellington, Sept. 1, 1814.</p>
<p>My very dear Friend,</p>
<p>I <span class="smcap">feel</span> thankful that a day of
comparative leisure enables me to fulfil my engagement as to
writing to you.&nbsp; It is the Lord&rsquo;s goodness; and I
cannot help considering it as one out of many thousand other
instances in which prayer and simple reliance upon God tend most
effectually to forward us in our concerns.&nbsp; I fear to trust
my own unstable and treacherous heart, and therefore begged of
God that he would graciously assist me; and, were I to do so
constantly, how much better would it be for me! how many good
plans and well concerted schemes, instead of being rendered
abortive, would have been sped and prospered!&nbsp; But, trusting
in the goodness of the plan, instead of the blessing of the Lord,
and, at the same time, overlooking my own utter insufficiency, I
have been manifestly left to learn lessons of dependence, through
the unwelcome medium of failure and disappointment.&nbsp; But,
after all the pains which a gracious God has been pleased to take
with me, how slow I am to learn, how unwilling to become nothing,
that God may become all in all.&nbsp; And yet this is the only
way in which we can be either extensively <a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>or
permanently blessed.&nbsp; We are dealt with as children; but on
which of his children will a judiciously affectionate parent
bestow the greatest honour?&nbsp; Not on the forward and
self-sufficient.&nbsp; This is a spirit which he must chasten and
subdue by patient and humiliating discipline.&nbsp; It is the
child who is modest, distrustful, and unassuming, who is
diffident of his abilities, and afraid of leaning to his own
understanding, that will meet with the countenance and support of
the wise and tender father.&nbsp; But to one of a contrary
temper, such a mode of treatment would be ruinous, and,
therefore, utterly inadmissible on the part of a parent whose
affectionate heart was regulated by a sound and enlightened
judgment.&nbsp; Ah, my dear friend, how often do we put it out of
the power even of the <i>tender Father of mercies</i> to speed
and prosper us!&nbsp; How much humiliating discipline are we
incessantly courting by attempting to rob God of that glory which
belongs to himself alone!</p>
<p>A few evenings ago I received a letter from my agent in town,
giving me an account of some loss which I had lately
sustained.&nbsp; I took my dear wife with me into my study, and
falling on our knees, we prayed to the Lord to bring us into a
ready acquiescence with his divine will, and to keep us from
every the least feeling of dissatisfaction or expression of
complaint.&nbsp; While engaged in prayer, those words, &ldquo;God
is love,&rdquo; came with sweet power to my mind.&nbsp; I felt
convinced that it was that divine attribute, and that alone,
which had appointed the circumstance; that I could not have done
so well without as with it; and, consequently, that I had far
more reason for gratitude and praise than for anything
else.&nbsp; Since that time how clearly have I seen that the
<i>love of God</i> is the only proper key to unlock all
God&rsquo;s dispensations, and that when this is used it will
open to us treasures of mercies and of blessings which would
otherwise be for ever closed from our view.&nbsp; The <a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span><span
class="smcap">Lord</span> teach me for the future to profit by
the instruction; and enable us to label, as it were, each passing
trial with some such inscription as this, &ldquo;From your loving
Father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You, my dear friend, have had much to bear; and perhaps Satan
has whispered at times into your mind those considerations which
are likely to distress and to discourage you; but all is well;
all originates in love; and, therefore, as Parnell so sweetly
teaches, &ldquo;Where you can&rsquo;t unravel,&rdquo; &ldquo;you
should learn to trust.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I hope you feel confidence in these blessed results of your
labours.&nbsp; What a word is that of our gracious
Redeemer&rsquo;s, and how worthy to be graven on the palms of
every minister of his truth! &ldquo;Said I not unto thee,
<i>if</i> thou wouldst <i>believe</i> thou shouldst see the glory
of God?&rdquo;&nbsp; Surely it is nothing but our unbelief which
hinders the Lord from laying bare his arm, and doing wondrous
things in righteousness.&nbsp; In our parish and neighbourhood we
have lately seen a far more extensive work both of conversion and
progression than we have ever yet been indulged with; and I
cannot but ascribe it to the many prayers which have been
recently offered up in reference to this point.&nbsp; Many of us
have felt great confidence that the Lord would revive his work
among us; and he who has taught us daily to pray that his kingdom
might come, has in no way disappointed our hope.&nbsp; We trust,
however, that what we have hitherto seen are merely the drops
before the shower.</p>
<p>Mary and King unite with me in kindest love to yourself and
dear Mrs. A., and I remain,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Your ever sincere and truly
affectionate Friend,<br />
<span class="smcap">George Mortimer</span>.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Mr. Mortimer, from his early connexion with the Methodists,
imbibed many of their views, and followed <a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>out some of
their practices.&nbsp; I cannot say that he succeeded in
convincing me of the expediency of the plan described in the
following letter, though possessed probably of some advantages;
nor do I think that he continued always to approve of the same;
but I think it right that he should speak for himself, and
therefore I shall give several copies or extracts of his letters
on the subject:&mdash;</p>
<h3>TO THE REV. JOHN ARMSTRONG.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Wellington, Salop. October 27,
1814.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Ah</span>, my dear friend, what need have
we all of being occasionally pulled down, stripped of our fancied
excellencies, spoiled of our boasted props, and laid low in
self-abasement and humility of soul at the feet of Jesus.&nbsp;
And considering this our need, how kind is it in the <span
class="smcap">Lord</span> to take the painful pains with us which
he does.&nbsp; He had much rather rejoice over us in unclouded
prosperity; but our perverseness will not suffer him, and
therefore he forces himself to grieve us.&nbsp; He constrains
himself to cut off the dangerous limb&mdash;to
amputate&mdash;when it would be injurious to spare.</p>
<p>We have two <i>classes</i>, after the manner of the
Methodists; one consisting of men, and the other of women.&nbsp;
The former led by Mr. Eyton, and the latter by myself.&nbsp; Out
of the men&rsquo;s class, Mr. E. has selected six young men, four
of whom go out on a Monday evening, in turns, and expound to the
poor in four cottages in different parts of the parish; and much
good, I trust, has already been seen resulting from the
plan.&nbsp; Mr. E. did not think of the classes till about a year
and a half ago; but we all feel truly thankful to God that they
were begun at last.&nbsp; You would have been struck at the
effects which soon <a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
45</span>began to follow.&nbsp; A standard, if I may so speak,
was by this means erected, and many, who in all probability would
have remained halting and hesitating till the very end of their
days, were induced, one after another, to flock around it, and I
have been surprised at the degree of help which they have all
received since they were thus united.&nbsp; And, in addition to
their own personal benefit, they soon became instrumental of good
to others.&nbsp; Our little society became a kind of nursery of
expounders, exhorters, and assistants in prayer; and now, instead
of a comparatively barren wilderness, we are rejoiced to behold,
in many places, an incipient garden of the <span
class="smcap">Lord</span>.</p>
<p>Another benefit I would just beg leave to notice, and that
refers to yourself.&nbsp; You will know much more of the state of
your people, you will obtain a greater insight into their
temptations, difficulties, and trials, and will be led to look
around you for the means of obviating, or else helping them to
bear them; and thus your manner of preaching will become far more
experimental, and, consequently, far more useful.&nbsp; Without
some such knowledge of our people as we thus obtain, our
discourses, as Mr. Jerram used to say, will be about it, and
about it, but seldom actually upon the mark.&nbsp; I have found a
very material benefit myself in this way, and I would not have
been without it for worlds.&nbsp; Now, my dear friend, what
hinders but that you should enter upon such a class
meeting?&nbsp; If you have only three or four, begin with them;
meet with them weekly; begin with singing and prayer; relate to
them the state of your own mind during the week, and then inquire
into the state of their&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Prayer may conclude.&nbsp;
Mr. E. began, I think, with only four, and was some weeks before
he got above two or three more; but now the men&rsquo;s class is
between thirty and forty, and the women&rsquo;s not far
short.&nbsp; Do not be afraid of the Methodistical appearance of
the procedure.&nbsp; It is full of benefits, <a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>and I have no
question but that if you can prevail upon yourself to adopt it,
yourself and thousands more will have eternal reason to bless God
for its institution.&nbsp; And, under such circumstances, should
a name, or an appearance, cause you a moment&rsquo;s
hesitation?&nbsp; I trust it will not. * * *</p>
<p>I remain,</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Your very sincere Friend</p>
<p style="text-align: right">And Brother in the Lord,<br />
<span class="smcap">George Mortimer</span>.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The following letter is a beautiful manifestation of the
greatest humility as to his own Christian experience; it was
addressed to his sister:&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Wellington, Nov. 17th, 1814.</p>
<p>My dear Mary,</p>
<p>I <span class="smcap">have</span> to thank my dear mother and
yourself for the printed account, and the accompanying letter
relative to the Lord&rsquo;s gracious dealings with our dear
departed brother: they have proved highly interesting, and, I
trust, truly profitable to us.&nbsp; May our ears ever be
disposed to listen to, and our hearts prepared to receive,
instruction from all the gracious means which a God of infinite
love and mercy is ever taking with us, in order to our good, and
when it comes to our turn to drop the garments of mortality may
it be with us, as it was with dear James, to be clothed with
those of light.&nbsp; A tear may now and then involuntarily
escape me when I advert to the difference between his envied
situation and my own.&nbsp; He quite safe, I still surrounded
with danger; still called to many a conflict with the
Christian&rsquo;s threefold enemy; still smarting from the wounds
which my own unfaithfulness and presumption rendered expedient
that I should receive.&nbsp; But I comfort <a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>myself with
the recollection that the time will soon come when I hope to be
crowned as victor, and that my continuance here below is with the
merciful intention of giving me increased opportunity of getting
some fresh jewels to my crown, and of getting those brightened
which are already there.&nbsp; May the great Captain of my
salvation so stand by me, that all these His gracious purposes
may be abundantly answered!&nbsp; I bless God, I do feel an
increasing desire to live to Him, and to the glory of his name;
and there are times in which I feel that I have an increased
power to do so.&nbsp; When I compare the general state of my
religious experience with what it formerly was, I find that I am
enabled to exercise more uniformly submission to his divine will,
and to depend upon him more habitually for the supply of all my
wants.&nbsp; I feel in many respects more crucified to the world,
and the world seems to have become more so to me; so that I care
but little about a variety of things which were at one time
accustomed to engross much of my time and affections.&nbsp; In a
word, I am led to conclude, that the life which I now live in the
flesh is somewhat more a life of faith in the Son of God, a
simple dependence and reliance upon Him, as my wisdom,
righteousness, strength, and happiness, as my all-sufficient
Saviour.&nbsp; But while I feel great cause for thankfulness in
these respects, yet how far am I from so walking as to please my
God!&nbsp; I was thinking over the state of my mind the other
morning, and I felt deeply humbled before the Lord on account of
it.&nbsp; My religion strikes me as being more superficial and
circumstantial, than deep, inward, and spiritual.&nbsp; I possess
a measure of <i>union</i> with God, but very little
<i>communion</i> with Him.&nbsp; I am engaged in His works, and
doing His will in the main, but I hold slight and frequently
interrupted converse with Him.&nbsp; But how can such a walk be
pleasing unto God?&nbsp; But, perhaps, you will not be able to
enter <a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>into
my feelings&mdash;as connected with this my defect in religious
experience&mdash;unless I have recourse to some familiar
illustration.&nbsp; An individual may be walking by my side,
towards the place which I would have him proceed to, and in the
way in which I would have him walk; but should he walk for miles
and hours together, in total silence, never, during these
intervals, drop a word expressive of his views and feelings,
never communicate to me the least thing which is passing in his
mind; or should he manifest a similar indifference concerning my
communications to him, should he never listen to my voice, or
suffer himself to be so amused with the surrounding prospect, or
the incidents of the journey, as to have no ear for me, what
opinion should I form of such an individual?&nbsp; Would he be
walking so as to please me?&nbsp; The application is
easy&mdash;we may be walking in God&rsquo;s commands towards the
place he would have us direct our face, and in those paths which
he has been pleased to appoint; but if we do not hold converse
with him, if we are backward to tell him what is passing in our
minds, or if we have no ear to listen to his kind communications,
suffering ourselves to be previously engaged with the things by
which we are surrounded, how little can such a walk be gratifying
to the blessed God!&nbsp; Now, my dear Mary, here is my defect; I
do not cultivate, as I ought, that loving, gracious intercourse
with my loving Redeemer which it is my privilege to enjoy: not
only many moments, but, sometimes, even hours, pass without
anything like direct communion with him.&nbsp; Oh, when shall I
be able to adopt the language&mdash;the beautiful expressive
language&mdash;of one of Mr. Wesley&rsquo;s hymns&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Far above all earthly things,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; While yet my hands are here employed;<br />
Sees my soul the King of kings,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And freely talks with God.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>Let us
help one another, my dear sister, in this important matter by our
mutual and fervent prayers.</p>
<p>Good Archbishop Leighton, alluding to the effects of
intercourse kept up on the part of ministers with the blessed
God, has happily expressed himself:&mdash;&ldquo;They that
converse most with the King, and are inward with him, know most
of the affairs of state, and even the secrets of them, which are
hid from others.&nbsp; And, certainly, those of God&rsquo;s
messengers who are oftenest with Himself, cannot but understand
their business best, and know most of His meaning, and the
affairs of His kingdom.&rdquo;&nbsp; What a luminous proof did
this most excellent man afford in his conduct of the truth of his
own assertion, and what need have we, who are the ministers and
stewards of the same mysteries, to follow him as he also followed
Christ!</p>
<h3>TO THE REV. JOHN ARMSTRONG.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Wellington, Salop. Dec. 29,
1814.</p>
<p>My dear Friend,</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * * * *</p>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> my last I mentioned to you the
illness and expected removal of my youngest brother, James.&nbsp;
He has since been called to his rest, and I am truly thankful to
be enabled to state that his death was attended with
circumstances highly satisfactory, especially when it is
remembered that he was not in any way a communicative lad, but,
on the contrary, very silent and reserved.&nbsp; Well! he is
gone&mdash;gone, I trust, to eternal glory.&nbsp; The Lord, in
his rich mercy, prepare us all to follow him!&nbsp; He was the
youngest among us, and the least likely to be first called.&nbsp;
I hope that we have most of us been induced by the circumstance
to watch and to be sober; &ldquo;so to number <a
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>our days as
to apply our hearts unto wisdom.&rdquo;&nbsp; As far as regards
myself, I think I may say that the lesson has been very
salutary.&nbsp; I have been led to consider myself as the next
which shall be called, and, of course, eternal and invisible
things have appeared exceedingly near.&nbsp; I thank God that
death has no sting to me.&nbsp; Its sting is sin, and that my
gracious Redeemer has mercifully removed.&nbsp; The anticipation,
therefore, far from being a means of uneasiness, is matter of
entire and sober satisfaction; not that I have any cause for
disquietude here below&mdash;not that I have any restlessness of
desire arising from a querulous or pettish feeling of
discontent.&nbsp; No, my dear friend, God has been, and still
continues to be, abundant in mercy and truth.&nbsp; But still
these things are not my God&mdash;this world is not my
home.&nbsp; I seem to myself like a school-boy very agreeably
placed at school&mdash;fond of his master, pleased with his
companions, and interested by his studies, he has every sober
ground for satisfaction, and, as such, does not pettishly wish to
be gone&mdash;does not for a moment think of leaving till his
vacation shall arrive: but still the thoughts of home delight
him, and when the summer which calls him there arrives, he most
cheerfully complies&mdash;his kind master, his pleasing
companions&mdash;his engaging studies&mdash;all are most gladly
left; for these are not his home.&nbsp; Ah, my dear friend, how
lightly should we all sit to the things beneath, to those which
are nearest and dearest, did we but consider heaven more as our
<i>own</i> place&mdash;as our heavenly Father&rsquo;s house!</p>
<p>I often wish, my dear friend, that the bounds of our
habitation were so fixed that we might not only correspond with,
but face to face converse with, each other.&nbsp; This privilege
I now enjoy with my friend King, who for nearly a year has been
on the same spot, and even in the same house.&nbsp; But I still
feel my heart longing after my absent friend.&nbsp; This <a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>indeed may
originate in some latent feeling of ingratitude and discontent,
which leads me to overlook the mercy vouchsafed, and to long for
that denied.&nbsp; And yet I am not conscious that this is
altogether the case: hardly a day elapses in which I do not thank
God for the blessing granted me, through the medium of my present
friend.&nbsp; He is a most choice and valuable young
man&mdash;one of ten thousand.&nbsp; And yet the question
frequently arises in my mind, why did I ever know&mdash;why did I
feel so exceedingly attached to my absent friend, if it were not
the intention of a gracious and indulgent God to give him to me
in like manner?&nbsp; But the ways of the Lord are in the great
deep: his footsteps are not known; and yet gracious, though
unknown, I would therefore be thankful that I have a
dear&mdash;dear&mdash;very dear friend, to whom I can write, and
for whom I can pray, if I can do no more; and my mind is solaced
and comforted with the hope that a day is coming in which we
shall join to part no more; that glorious inheritance is at hand
where some adjacent mansion shall be assigned us, or where
distance shall prove no impediment or barrier to our
intercourse.&nbsp; May our loving Saviour, who is &ldquo;the way,
the truth, and the life,&rdquo; guide us and ours all safe to
this glorious kingdom!</p>
<p>I remain,</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Your very affectionate Friend and
old Collegian,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Mort</span>.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Another of his friends, the Rev. J. C., the present rector of
a parish in Cheshire, may be here introduced&mdash;a friend whom
he esteemed very highly.&nbsp; This gentleman, in the former
years of his life, was engaged in business, and his friend was
very desirous of detaching his mind from this pursuit, and of
leading him to turn his attention to the sacred office.&nbsp; In
one of his early letters pressing this <a name="page52"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 52</span>change upon his consideration, he
makes the following pertinent remark:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It is not easy, when fixed by
circumstances, and extensively surrounded by our secular
concerns, to follow the example of Matthew, and immediately to
arise.&nbsp; The din of business and the clamour of dear friends
drown the soft intimations of our passing Lord, and, questioning
the reality of his call, we find it difficult to leave all
behind.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the following extract of a letter to the Rev. J. Armstrong,
Mr. Mortimer states what he conceived to be the qualifications of
a minister of the word in a foreign or uncultivated soil; and
also his views of Arminianism.&nbsp; His remarks on the latter
subject were addressed to the editor, to whom, in a former
letter, he had given some account of a plan which he and some of
his friends had devised of raising a fund for the purchase of
livings, and had given to the designation of the object an
Arminian character.&nbsp; The editor, who has often been
considered as a Calvinist, wrote to his friend to say he objected
to the title of his projected association; adding, that, in the
event of his returning home invalided, or from other causes, he
could expect to derive no benefit from his friend&rsquo;s
patronage:&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Wellington, Salop. Feb. 25th,
1815.</p>
<p>My dear Friend,</p>
<p style="text-align: center">** * * * * * *</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Were</span> I required to point out those
qualifications which should distinguish the minister of the word
in a foreign or uncultivated soil, I should not specify those
qualities which are too exclusively dwelt upon by many.&nbsp; I
should not inquire into the fervour of his spirit, the commanding
or winning nature of his aspect and address, the robustness of
his frame&mdash;<a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
53</span>&ldquo;his iron sinews, and his bones of
brass;&rdquo;&mdash;all these things are good auxiliaries, but
they are not essentials.&nbsp; The grand requisite seems to be
this, a quiet steady application to present duty, combined with a
peaceful and unbroken reliance upon the Lord; for if an
individual be possessed of a spirit and temper which this conduct
supposes, he must succeed.&nbsp; Hosts of opposing difficulties
will, one after another, fall before him like the petrified band
who came to seize the person of our Lord.&nbsp; All his patient
labours, the produce of his faith, shall bear the approving seal
of God&mdash;all that he doeth shall prosper.&nbsp; But, if
present duty be neglected, or supinely, or uninterestingly
conducted&mdash;if his reliance and confidence on God be
broken&mdash;if his oppressed spirit sink under every wave of
discouragement which for the trial of his faith is permitted to
pass over him&mdash;under such circumstances, prosperity is
impossible; for even our gracious and our willing Lord can in no
wise help us.&nbsp; From these considerations, I feel truly
thankful that your spirit faints not, that your confidence in God
still remains, and that you still apply yourself to your arduous
work.&nbsp; This Moravian (I should rather have said this
Christlike) spirit will, with the superadded blessing of the
Lord, bring to you and your dear flock a train of mercies far
exceeding the most sanguine of your expectations.&nbsp; &ldquo;Be
strong, therefore, and of a good courage; fear not, neither be
dismayed; and then the Lord thy God will be with thee
whithersoever thou goest.&rdquo;&nbsp; He will &ldquo;Cover thy
head in the day of battle; he will take hold of shield and
buckler; he will fight for thee, and thou shalt hold thy
peace.&rdquo;&nbsp; But while I am thus alluding to your
ministerial duties, I would again recommend to you what I took
the liberty of urging upon you somewhat at large in a former
letter.&nbsp; I allude to class meetings.&nbsp; Whatever you do,
my dear Armstrong, do not omit these.&nbsp; I have seen already,
and daily continue to <a name="page54"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>see, advantages the most unequivocal
resulting from them; and am convinced that no one endued either
with a spiritual mind, or with a desire after it, would make an
experiment of their efficacy without most convincingly perceiving
it.&nbsp; In your own case, I have no question but that the
adoption of the plan I am recommending, would become quite an era
to you in spiritual prosperity, both as a church and as a private
individual&mdash;an epocha upon which you would ever look back
with the most unqualified delight.</p>
<p>You seem prepared, my good friend, to receive from me somewhat
of an Arminian trimming for the heretical alteration which you
have ventured to propose as connected with our &ldquo;Living and
Perpetual Advowson Plan.&rdquo;&nbsp; It happens, however, that I
feel no such disposition at present; not that I am less anxious
than before for the maintenance of <i>sound doctrine</i> within
the walls of our churches, but because I have a good hope that in
your case a caution upon these points is almost
unnecessary.&nbsp; I trust that, notwithstanding the force of
certain prejudices imbibed in the early part of your Christian
life, the leaven of <i>real unadulterated truth</i> has been
introduced into your mind, and that a time will come in which it
will predominate to the leavening of the whole lump.&nbsp; I
should be glad to find that this was the case even now; for,
though the circumstances in which you are placed at present
forbid the introduction of any extensive evil, yet still, I fear
that some degree of evil will almost unavoidably find an
entrance.&nbsp; For every portion of error has its corresponding
portion of evil.&nbsp; <i>Truth</i>, <i>simple</i>,
<i>unmixed</i> truth, is that which sanctifies, and truth
alone.&nbsp; But as to endeavouring to lead you through all the
mazes of controversy and debate to this desirable end, I have not
the least intention, nor even desire.&nbsp; I had rather leave
you in the hands of God, by prayer, begging that He, the God of
Truth and the Father of Lights <a name="page55"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 55</span>would, in his mercy, condescend to
instruct you himself, and, guided by him, you will then be led
into all truth.&nbsp; As to the alteration you propose, we are
perfectly of your mind, that the word &ldquo;Arminian&rdquo; had
better be omitted, and as such intend to drop it.&nbsp; For,
though we should naturally be led to make choice of individuals
the most accordant with our own views, yet neither liberality nor
candour would teach us to exclude others.&nbsp; Besides, all the
good purposes arising from the insertion of the term may
certainly be answered without.&nbsp; It will be well known in
whose hands the conduct of the affair is vested; this of itself
will show the <i>bias</i> of our mind, and this is all we
wish.&nbsp; Exclusion upon the general scale is certainly no part
of our intention; we are thankful, therefore, for your friendly
hint.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * * * * *</p>
<p>We all unite in kindest love to you and yours, and I

<h3>TO THE REV. JOHN ARMSTRONG.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Wellington, Salop. May 1st,
1815.</p>
<p>My dear Friend,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Your</span> last letter gave me an account
of dear Mrs. A.&rsquo;s indisposition.&nbsp; She has been much on
my mind of late.&nbsp; I feared lest her protracted illness
should be the forerunner of something worse; and my mind shrunk
from the idea of the painful circumstances in which yourself
would be placed, should her removal be the ultimate issue.&nbsp;
But I have left the whole in the hands of our wise and loving
God, and I have no doubt but that all will be well.&nbsp; To be a
stranger in a strange land, oppressed with cares and surrounded
<a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>with more
than ordinary difficulties, and at the same time reft of his
bosom friend, the sharer of his troubles, and the assuager of his
griefs; this is a trial from which the mind revolts.&nbsp; But
still, &ldquo;God is faithful, who will not suffer us to be
tempted above that we are able.&rdquo;&nbsp; He will proportion
our supports to our trials, and with Christ&rsquo;s strengthening
us we can not only do, but bear all things; and, therefore, all
that we have to do is to shut our eye, and to yield our hand, and
to suffer our kind Lord to lead us whithersoever he shall
please.&nbsp; We have nothing to do with anticipation respecting
the future.&nbsp; Grace is indeed promised to us, not however in
advance&mdash;not as a stock which we may possess beforehand, but
as we need it.&nbsp; &ldquo;As thy day, thy strength shall
be.&rdquo;&nbsp; I have found this consideration a great source
of comfort to my own mind when I have been recoiling at the
painful possibilities of the morrow; for, though I could not bear
this and the other trial to-day with my present strength, yet
to-morrow&rsquo;s strength may and will be sufficient for me,
provided I do but look for it.&nbsp; Were a martyr&rsquo;s trials
in reserve for me, a martyr&rsquo;s grace would also be prepared
for me.</p>
<p>With regard to myself all at present is peaceful in the
extreme; my mind calmly reposing on the God of all my mercies in
tranquil dependence.&nbsp; My wife, my children, my servants, my
property, all so suitable, so calculated to administer to my
comfort, and to leave me no reasonable earthly wish
unfulfilled.&nbsp; All, my dear friend, is so well; all so
mercifully regulated, that I sometimes look around me with
surprise, and am almost led to suspect lest the treacherous calm
should be merely the forerunner of some tremendous storm.&nbsp;
But the consideration does not alarm me; for &ldquo;God is
love.&rdquo;</p>

month of May, 1815, he was invited to Madeley by many of the
parishioners, a deputation from whom waited upon the rector, the
Rev. H. Burton, to request he might be appointed curate; and,
accordingly, he removed thither on the 8th of the ensuing
month.&nbsp; The following letter addressed to the editor refers
to the event, and enters somewhat into the particulars of
it:&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Madeley, near Shiffnal, Salop.<br />
June 15th, 1815.</p>
<p>My dear Friend,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Few</span> things were further from my
thoughts, when I last wrote to you, than that I should now be
addressing a letter to you from the above-mentioned place; but,
&ldquo;the Lord&rsquo;s ways are not our ways, nor his thoughts
our thoughts;&rdquo; we may contrive, but he controls.&nbsp; I
had imagined that my lot was, for some time to come, assigned to
me among my dear people at Wellington, and that in my late house
of mercies, surrounded by the family of my excellent vicar, and
his valuable assistant, I should continue to flourish and grow
like a tree planted by rivers of waters.&nbsp; But the Lord has
seen fit to transplant me; of its being his work I feel fully
assured; and, therefore, I can now expect my comforts and
blessings in a different way and through other channels.&nbsp;
Thus, goodness and mercy have followed me all the days of my
life, and will still follow me.&nbsp; I do, indeed, quite wonder
at the change; it seems more like a dream than otherwise, that I
should be fixed in this place and parish, of which I had so often
read, and which has always been associated in my mind with that
wonderful and astonishing man of God, the late venerable Mr. De
la Fl&egrave;chere.&nbsp; But you will, perhaps, wish to know the
steps <a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
58</span>which led me hither.&nbsp; Mr. Walters, the late curate
(or rather the present, for he does not leave till next Tuesday)
having heard of a situation which seemed, in many respects, more
congenial to his views than that of Madeley, gave notice of its
being his intention to leave, in the church on Sunday after
divine service.&nbsp; The people were much surprised at the
communication; but since the choice of their minister has usually
been left to themselves, they immediately began to look around
them; and, having fixed upon me, they begged of Mr. Eyton, that
he would give me up, and of myself, that I would undertake the
cure of the place.&nbsp; Had I been disposed to consult merely
with flesh and blood, Madeley would have been the last place to
which I should have consented to have gone; but, as dear Mrs.
Fletcher and the people of all descriptions seemed desirous of my
coming among them, I thought it would be wrong to resist the
order of God, and, as such, professed a willingness to let them
do anything with me which they should please.&nbsp; A deputation
was accordingly sent to Mr. Burton, the vicar, who resides on
another living a few miles off, requesting him to appoint
me.&nbsp; He received them, in the first instance, with a degree
of coolness which led them to conclude that there was but little
hope.&nbsp; He did not even tell them that he would consider the
application, but put them off with mentioning another person who,
he thought, would suit him.&nbsp; Under such circumstances,
prayer seemed the only resort, and to the prayers of the church I
believe I have been given, and to these alone.&nbsp; In about ten
days after the first application, I heard through the medium of a
relation of his, that he had some intentions of appointing me,
and as such I waited upon him, and was received both by himself
and his wife with a degree of cordiality and attention which
quite surprised me.&nbsp; We soon came to terms, and I have since
heard, from various <a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
59</span>sources, that he is not only well disposed towards me,
but quite congratulates himself upon my having undertaken his
cure.&nbsp; Such wonderful revolutions, both in mind and in
circumstances, is the Lord able to effect.&nbsp; All things being
thus far adjusted, I began to look out for a situation for
myself, and for a suitable tenant for the house I was about to
leave, and in both respects have I been led most remarkably to
see the hand of God.&nbsp; The house I now occupy has been
desired by many, as it is the only one in the place at all
suitable for a person in my circumstances; but a disagreement
among the persons who had to let it, prevented everything like an
amicable prospect, and it has been strangely left in the midst of
all for me.&nbsp; How kind and how condescending is the care of
God!&nbsp; How does it reach even to the minutest particulars,
and much more to the commodiously and pleasantly assigning the
bounds of our habitation.&nbsp; Our removal also has been
attended with blessings.&nbsp; Scarcely anything, in the shape of
injury, has hitherto been perceived, and what trivial matters
have been noticed have only tended to increase our gratitude, by
shewing us what might have been, had not God given his charge as
connected with them.&nbsp; You will smile, perhaps, at these kind
of enumerations; but I feel a pleasure in adverting to them
myself, and, therefore, I must beg your indulgence.&nbsp;
&ldquo;A special and minute providence is an object of my firm
belief, as well as a source of my calmest and most extensive
joys.&nbsp; I love to dwell on such a truth as this, &lsquo;The
very hairs of your head are all numbered.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>You have heard, perhaps, of the Honourable Mr. Ryder having
been made Dean of Wells, and of his most decided and open
exhibition of piety in his exalted situation.&nbsp; About a month
ago he was made Bishop of Gloucester, an event which has filled
the hearts of the pious in our Establishment <a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>with
inexpressible gratitude.&nbsp; It may, indeed, be said by us on
such an occasion, &ldquo;The Lord hath done great things for us,
whereof we are glad,&rdquo; and to his name would we ascribe the
praise.&nbsp; A lady of my acquaintance happened, at the time
when his appointment was known, to be dining in a party at which
Mr. Wilberforce was present, and she states, that two or three
times he could not help saying in the most animated manner,
&ldquo;I am afraid, I am too glad at it, but it is such a great
thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">I remain,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Your ever affectionate Friend,<br />
<span class="smcap">Geo. Mortimer</span>.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Mr. Mortimer&rsquo;s post at Madeley was, upon his entrance on
the duties of it, one beset with great difficulties; but by the
blessing of God upon his Christian spirit and conduct he overcame
them all.&nbsp; This will be seen from the following extracts of
three letters, the first and third directed to his sister, and
the second to his friend abroad.</p>
<p>After alluding to the difficulties referred to, he says,
August, 1815:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I feel a power to stand still and see the
salvation of God; my chief attention is directed, not to outward
circumstances, but to my own spirit.&nbsp; I am desirous of
cultivating kindness and affection, and am convinced that so long
as nothing is cherished by me contrary to love, all will
eventually be well.&nbsp; We have had a most gratifying visit
from Mr. and Mrs. Butterworth, and feel truly thankful for the
kind providence which brought them among us.&nbsp; What a
stimulus to increased activity for God and our fellow-creatures
does the animating example of such a character as Mr. B.
afford.&nbsp; Such sobriety of mind, such solidity of judgment,
such earnestness of endeavour: I could not help applying to him
the words of my favourite Herbert,</p>
<p><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
61</span>&lsquo;Let thy mind still be bent, still plotting
where,<br />
And when, and how, the business may be done.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Fletcher still continues to speak once a week to
her people and also to meet her class; her breathing is much
affected, and she continues to break very fast.&nbsp; She spoke
on the Monday evening, while Mr. and Mrs. B. were here, for the
last time on the weekdays.&nbsp; The assemblage was highly
gratifying.&nbsp; After we came home, we reckoned upwards of
fifty who had come from Wellington to hear her.&nbsp; Such honour
has this distinguished saint of God.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right">Madeley, near Shiffnal, Salop. Sept.
1st, 1815.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Since</span> I last wrote to you I have
had to encounter many difficulties in my parish, but I am
thankful to state that they have now nearly subsided.&nbsp; You
must understand that my parish abounds with Methodists, or at
least that the greater part of the serious people are such, and
of course the church, though generally attended by them once a
day, is looked upon as a mere secondary concern.&nbsp; Now though
I respect the Methodists, so long as they keep to their own
place, and would gladly give to them, under such circumstances,
the right hand of fellowship, yet when they leave their proper
place and wish to occupy that post of pre-eminence which the Lord
has given to the church, then I feel it to be my duty to step
forward and to show them where they ought to remain.&nbsp; My
predecessors here, namely, Mr. Fletcher, Melville Horne, and Mr.
Walters, all of them preached at regular times in the Methodist
chapels.&nbsp; When I came here they solicited me, and Mrs.
Fletcher among others was exceedingly urgent.&nbsp; I felt it my
duty, however, most stoutly to refuse.&nbsp; This, as you may
suppose, gave great offence, and they imagined that instead of a
friend and encourager, they had most <a name="page62"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 62</span>strangely stumbled upon a most
determined enemy.&nbsp; Time, however, has shown them that they
misjudged me, and that I can be friendly and yet not go all the
lengths which they, through a regard to precedents, had most
unaccountably expected; and now, the sober-minded come to church
as usual, and everything seems to be proceeding in a spirit of
love and of kindness.&nbsp; It is true, that some of the more
violent have seceded, but this is no more than I might reasonably
have expected, and, to speak the truth, no more than what I
should have wished; for I could never have felt at home, with
individuals of this description.&nbsp; They have always been
troublesome characters, and had they remained, they would
doubtless have been troublesome to me.&nbsp; While the mouths of
many were opened loudly against me, I one day met with an old
Methodist of the place, who was a convert of dear Mr.
Fletcher&rsquo;s.&nbsp; In the course of conversation, I said to
him, &ldquo;Well Mr. P., do you think that I have been a sinner
above all others, in not preaching in your chapels?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why, sir,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to speak truth, I must
say that I think no such thing, and I have always said, that as
you are our minister you ought to know your own business a great
deal better than we do, and therefore that we have nothing to do
but to be quiet.&rdquo;&nbsp; I was much struck at the time with
his remark, and I believe, now, that the generality think with
him.&nbsp; My mind was at first much pained, but I endeavoured to
maintain through the whole a loving demeanour and a praying
spirit.&nbsp; I said little, took care to avoid all exaggeration,
and yet, at the same time, kept steadily to my point.&nbsp; And
God has stood by me and brought me through in a way that I could
hardly have supposed.&nbsp; To his name be all the praise.</p>
<p>You will be pleased to hear that one of my younger brothers,
Thomas, has recently been truly converted to God, and wishes to
enter into the church.&nbsp; My <a name="page63"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 63</span>father most cordially enters into his
views, and has been urgent upon me to receive him into my house,
by way of preparation for college.&nbsp; This I at length
consented to do.&nbsp; And though it is somewhat of trouble to me
to do my duty towards him, in point of attention&mdash;for he is
quite a studious young man&mdash;yet I feel that his being with
us is quite in the Lord&rsquo;s order, and am truly thankful for
that grace which has changed him, and that providence which has
directed his steps among us.&nbsp; From a letter which I saw from
a Methodist preacher, who attended the conference last month, I
understand that no less than thirteen preachers in their
connexion have left them with the intention of preparing for
orders.&nbsp; These are the men we want in our churches!&nbsp;
What does our excellent establishment want, but <i>Arminian
preachers</i> and <i>Methodist discipline</i>!&nbsp; But I must
forbear lest I get a second trimming.&nbsp; Leaving joking
however, aside, I felt truly thankful to hear of this, and I hope
many will follow their good example.&nbsp; The Church wants them,
and the Methodists can well spare them.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: right">Madeley, Sept. 26th, 1815.</p>
<p>You will be pleased to find that matters are proceeding with
quietness and comfort in my parish.&nbsp; For some weeks past I
have not heard the least syllable of complaint relative to my
first obnoxious proceedings.&nbsp; The church is increasingly
attended, and the spirit of God seems among us in the application
of the word.&nbsp; I feel now at length thoroughly convinced that
my coming here was of God.&nbsp; All I fear is lest my bodily
strength should not be quite equal to my duty.&nbsp; My Sunday
work is certainly fatiguing.</p>
<h3><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>TO THE
REV. JOHN ARMSTRONG.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Madeley, near Shiffnal, Salop. Oct.
26th, 1815.</p>
<p>My dear Armstrong,</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * * * * *</p>
<p>Since I last wrote to you I have seen it my duty to give up
myself wholly to the work of the Lord.&nbsp; I am ashamed to
confess to you, that the former years of my ministry have been
very partially devoted to his service.&nbsp; I have too
frequently picked and chosen among my duties, avoided too many
which seemed to promise humiliation and mortification, and
entered upon others only so far as they left me an opportunity of
cultivating and enjoying other more favourite pursuits.&nbsp; Oh,
my dear friend, what a cage of unclean birds is the polluted
heart of man, and how many corners of it still remain impure,
even after it has been for the most part cleansed.&nbsp; How much
selfishness, (latent, indeed, or glossed over with some
speciousness of appearance,) still keeps lurking behind.&nbsp;
The Lord, however, has very mercifully been leading me to part
first with one favourite pursuit and then with another, till at
last I seem to have but one business, and that is, to do the will
of him who has called me to the ministry.&nbsp; That I perform
this business in such a way as daily humbles me, and fills me
with confusion of face, I need scarcely tell you; for you have
long known the pride and the naughtiness of my heart, and, though
I keep fighting with my spiritual enemies, and am determined by
the grace of God, neither to find for them any apology, nor to
give them any quarter, yet I am but an unskilful combatant, and
fall under a severe wound <a name="page65"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 65</span>instead of habitually conquering
through him who hath loved me.&nbsp; As to my parish, I am very
thankful to be able to state that matters are going on very
comfortably.&nbsp; The spirit of dissent seems to be weekly
abating, and all seems harmony and love.&nbsp; Two of the
principal men among us have not only given the most cordial and
unexpected support, but have discovered a degree of seriousness
under the word, and a willingness to converse about it, when not
actually hearing it, as encourages me to hope, that they are
inquirers after the things which make for their peace.&nbsp; I
was much struck yesterday with the very friendly conduct of a Mr.
A., one of the masters of a considerable coal and iron work in
the neighbourhood.&nbsp; I had been inquiring about a place where
I might go near the Iron Bridge, one of the most populous places
in the parish, to expound the Scriptures and thus prepare them,
by means of this stepping stone, for an attendance upon the
church, and for their meeting in one of our little classes.&nbsp;
I soon heard of a room over the market place, which was employed
as a day school, nicely accommodated with benches, and capable of
holding between two and three hundred people; I was told it
belonged to Mr. A., but was let by him to the person who now held
it, upon the express condition, that it should never be used for
any religious purpose.&nbsp; An application under such
circumstances seemed somewhat uncertain, but when I waited upon
him, he expressed not only his willingness, but his great
satisfaction in having it so employed, and told me, moreover,
that he would give immediate orders to his foreman to see that
everything by way of whitewashing, and so on, should be done, so
as to make it as comfortable as might be.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
know how it is, but I feel my heart peculiarly united with this
amiable man.&nbsp; One night, after spending two or three hours
in his company, I felt just the same sensation of indescribable
union which I felt <a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
66</span>towards yourself the first day I knew you.&nbsp; O how
should I rejoice to be made serviceable to his soul, and to meet
him a saved character in the day of the Lord Jesus.&nbsp; My Iron
Bridge meeting I begin to morrow evening.&nbsp; I feel it much
upon my mind, and should be greatly obliged by your praying for a
particular blessing as connected with it.&nbsp; The population
there and within a short distance extends to some thousands. * *
* *</p>
<p>With our kind and united regards to Mrs. A. and yourself,</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Believe me, my dear Friend,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Yours, most affectionately,<br />
G. <span class="smcap">Mortimer</span>.</p>
<h3>TO HIS SISTER.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Madeley, Nov. 20th, 1815.</p>
<p>My dear Mary,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs</span>. D. <span
class="smcap">Whitmore</span> has offered to enclose a letter for
me to yourself in her frank.&nbsp; I have availed myself of the
opportunity thus afforded me, and have the comfort of reflecting
that for once, at least, my poor scrawl will not cost more than
its worth.</p>
<p>Mrs. D. and Miss Whitmore have lately been spending a few days
with us, and they have left us with a pleasing and powerful
conviction of the blessedness resulting from the society of those
who live near to God.&nbsp; We felt, in the first instance,
somewhat of reluctance in inviting them; but, being persuaded
that the law of love required that we should seek our pleasure in
the endeavour to communicate pleasure to others, we thought it
right to break through our cozy habits of retirement, and to
welcome them under our roof.&nbsp; I need not tell you that we
have been abundantly repaid.&nbsp; Christian <a
name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>intercourse,
when sought and conducted on Christian principles, must be
productive of good, and I would gratefully adore the goodness of
the Lord for all the refreshment of spirit, and the improvement
of mind, which have been conveyed to me through them as
channels.&nbsp; How clearly, my dear Mary, would the Lord be
teaching us, provided that we would learn of him that the
faithful taking up of the cross, even in those matters which
appear but trivial and insignificant, is the most effectual way
of procuring present peace and future blessedness.&nbsp; In
short, that the spirit of surrender is the one thing needful, the
grand preparative for happiness and holiness here, and for
eternal glory hereafter.&nbsp; I do not know how you feel on this
point; but I must, with humiliation, confess to you, that this
yoke of Christ does not sit so gracefully and so easily upon me
as it ought.&nbsp; I would, however, be thankful that I am
endeavouring to bear it.&nbsp; I am comforted with the thought,
and I may say with the experience, that the effort to accommodate
it to my stubborn neck is the most effectual way of making it
natural and easy.&nbsp; I have been much helped to this endeavour
by a persuasion that the bearing of the cross is not the end, but
the way; that humiliations, mortifications, trials, and so on,
are only so many means which God is obliged to have recourse to
in order to communicate blessings; that he does not wish to
harass, pain, and mortify us, but to promote our comfort, and
that the moment we are ready to take up the cross, and begin to
submit to the only terms on which it is safe in God to bless us,
then he cheerfully avails himself of the opportunity of conveying
to us, not the pain which we anticipated, but some gracious token
of his love.&nbsp; &ldquo;For the Lord taketh pleasure in the
prosperity of his servants.&rdquo;&nbsp; His name, His nature, is
love.&nbsp; In my last, I think, I stated to you that matters
were going on pretty comfortably in my parish.&nbsp; I did not,
<a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>however,
enlarge, lest I should be conveying to you a more favourable idea
than contingent circumstances would authorize.&nbsp; I now feel
that gratitude towards God ought to lead me to speak to his
praise.&nbsp; Many persons in the place have, to say the least,
been very favourably impressed, both among the higher, as well as
the lower orders, and show a considerable change in the whole of
their demeanour.&nbsp; The congregation in the church, both
morning and evening, continues to increase; and the expositions,
both in the town and the outskirts of the parish, are fully
attended.&nbsp; If there is one thing more than another which
seems to encourage me, it is that of witnessing on all occasions,
that the Lord has graciously given to me what I have all along
been led more particularly to pray for&mdash;the heart and
affections of my dear people.&nbsp; They not only
tolerate&mdash;they evidently love me.&nbsp; I seem to myself the
same poor blundering stutterer as ever, and yet they meet me with
pleasure, and go from my ministrations with profit.&nbsp; The
Lord make and keep me humble and thankful!&nbsp; I sometimes
think that all this is too good to last, that the peaceful calm
is but the harbinger of the treacherous storm; I feel, however,
that this is no necessary conclusion.&nbsp; Could humility and
gratitude be the predominating feeling of our mind, we then might
be safely trusted with success.&nbsp; But this is the grand
difficulty&mdash;pride and self-congratulation are ever apt to
insinuate themselves into our minds, and then adversity is
necessary.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is difficult,&rdquo; as the pious
Leighton observes, &ldquo;to carry a full cup even.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Pray for me, my dear sister, that all the will of the Lord may be
done in me, and by me, and that no evils on my part may put any
impediment to the free course and glorification of God&rsquo;s
blessed word.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The following letter to his friend, Mr., now the Rev. John
Cooper, will show how much Mr. Mortimer <a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>was in
advance of the time in which he wrote on the subject of
lay-agency&mdash;a kind of help which, at that time, was
considered of very questionable propriety; but which has now come
to be admitted very generally, as expedient to meet the pressing
wants of a rapidly increasing population.&nbsp; These wants,
indeed, the editor believes can never be effectually supplied by
any means less than an extensive augmentation of the number of
<i>clerical</i> labourers.&nbsp; To supply these means, he
regrets much that the Lord Primate, together with the Episcopal
Bench, should not see it to be their duty to admit to
deacon&rsquo;s orders upon a lower standard of literary
attainments than is now required; keeping persons so ordained, if
it be thought good, in that order, until they possess the usual
portion of literary and theological knowledge, as well as the
ordinary title for priest&rsquo;s orders.&nbsp; On this subject
also, as will be seen from the same letter, Mr. Mortimer appears
to have been equally in advance of his brethren; for, at that
time, the notion of such an augmentation of the number of the
clergy was little thought of, and would have been in most
quarters, as it is still in many, very generally condemned.&nbsp;
His opinion is, I think, a just one&mdash;viz. that the
<i>stability and true respectability</i> of the church is more
effectually promoted by sound piety, than by a certain portion of
Latin and Greek.&nbsp; &ldquo;The union of sound learning with
genuine piety, is what every one must admire and desire in a
Christian pastor; but a man may do immense good with nothing more
than an unlearned familiarity with the Scriptures, with sound
practical sense and activity, taking part in all the business of
the parish, and devoting himself to intercourse with men rather
than with books.&nbsp; I honour such men in the highest degree,
and think that they are among the most valuable ministers that
the church possesses.&rdquo; <a name="citation69"></a><a
href="#footnote69" class="citation">[69]</a>&nbsp; In the
meantime, <a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
70</span>however, until the clergy shall hear some proportion to
the population, we must have recourse to lay-assistants to
supply, in some small measure, the much to be deplored
deficiency.&nbsp; &ldquo;For myself, I will openly declare, that
I see not how we can dare for any of those small professional
objections, which may be urged, if they are sought for, against
every comprehensive scheme of good, to refuse such aid in this
our great necessity.&nbsp; It might be well enough for men,
sitting calmly in their closets, and forgetting all these mighty
issues, to cavil and to speculate, to raise difficulties as to
the exact mission of the lay-reader, and to wish (as which of us
does not wish?) that bands of zealous, well-timed, devoted
deacons ministered instead among these crowds; but it will not do
for us, my reverend brethren, who know that souls are thus
perishing around us, to bring upon ourselves the guilt of their
blood; to let them be unwarned, and drag us with them into their
destruction, because, through blinding prejudice, or the widely
comprehensive sin of omission, we have, for a whole generation,
shut out of a parish the light which might have streamed into
it.&rdquo; <a name="citation70"></a><a href="#footnote70"
class="citation">[70]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: right">Madeley, Dec. 4th, 1815.</p>
<p>My dear Friend,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the evening previous to my
receiving your very kind and truly acceptable letter, I had been
speaking in the town from those words of our Lord, &ldquo;Pray
ye, therefore, the Lord of the harvest, that he would send [or
rather <i>thrust</i>] forth labourers into his harvest;&rdquo;
and we all seemed to find it a profitable season, especially
when, in conclusion, we were praying that this important blessing
might be realized.&nbsp; <a name="page71"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 71</span>When your kind favour arrived, I saw
more than ever, the propriety of beseeching God to
&ldquo;<i>thrust</i>&rdquo; <i>them out</i>; for surely nothing
but main force can compel <i>desirable</i> labourers.&nbsp;
Others come at a moment&rsquo;s bidding&mdash;no useful
employments detain them&mdash;no endeared relatives or friends
hang about them, conscientiously and feelingly pressing their
continuance among them.&nbsp; But when a prepared labourer, one
whom &ldquo;the Lord of the harvest&rdquo; has previously been
fitting for his ministerial work; when such a one is fixed on,
none but the Lord himself can bring him out.&nbsp; I have,
therefore, only one resource, and that is prayer; this, however,
I am privileged to use, and this I must still hope will
eventually prevail.&nbsp; I assure you it would prove a source of
no small joy to myself to welcome you among us for your
initiatory work; for, independent of the personal gratification
and profit which I must promise myself, your help in various ways
would be exceedingly acceptable to the people.&nbsp; The most
populous parts of the parish greatly want help, and most gladly
avail themselves of the little which I and T&mdash; are able to
give them.&nbsp; At present I feel as though I could do but
little more: I have, indeed, <i>one</i> leisure evening during
the week; but even this they have been asking from me, and I fear
to deny them.&nbsp; My good friend need not, therefore, be afraid
of eating the bread of idleness, by secluding himself for a short
season among us; and with regard to his future employment, a
single month&rsquo;s actual residence in a place tolerably
populous will fully convince him how much work of the highest
importance will call for his daily and even hourly
attention.&nbsp; And are there not hundreds of places of this
description opening to our wishes?&nbsp; &ldquo;Truly the harvest
is plenteous,&rdquo; but with pain I must still add, that
&ldquo;the labourers are few.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I felt very thankful to hear of the determination <a
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>of your
friend B&mdash;, relative to entering into orders, and of the
kind and judicious conduct of the bishop&mdash;a conduct,
however, but seldom adopted.&nbsp; The determination of many on
the bench to admit those only into orders who have previously
been at college, is, indeed, calculated to secure a certain
portion of Latin and Greek in the Establishment; but, at the same
time, to exclude from it, in many instances, that which it more
needs and which would more effectually conduce to its stability
and true respectability; I mean, vital, genuine piety.&nbsp; What
a mercy it is, however, that their determination has been in so
many cases made void, and that there is not an instance to be
found in which a pious young man has eventually been
excluded.&nbsp; I think, I hinted to you, when you kindly visited
us in the summer, that I am too sensible of the dismal
forebodings of kind friends to let slip an opportunity of putting
you again in remembrance.&nbsp; But, my dear friend, with all our
zeal for the progress of the Lord&rsquo;s work around us, we must
not forget its progress <i>within</i> us.&nbsp; I know not how
you may feel, but, with regard to myself, I am constrained to
acknowledge, that while I am endeavouring to mind the vineyards
of others, I too frequently neglect my own.&nbsp; I get more and
more of the habit of thinking spiritually&mdash;speaking
spiritually&mdash;and even acting spiritually; but there seems in
my own experience a great deficiency in point of
<i>feeling</i>.&nbsp; Spiritual things are not brought home to my
own mind by an immediate and constant self-application.&nbsp; I
seem like a spiritual purveyor who is convinced that nothing but
spirituality will do, and, therefore, my constant endeavour is to
convey, and to exhibit it.&nbsp; But still, I fear, at times,
lest all this is more in reference to others than to
myself.&nbsp; I hope, however, that the act of conveying and
exhibiting it, is not altogether unattended with good to myself;
for the channel <a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>imbibes some of the water which passes through it; and,
as Leighton observes, &ldquo;The boxes in which our perfumes are
kept for garments and other uses, are themselves perfumed by
keeping them.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * * * * *</p>
<p>What a world of instruction is conveyed to us in that
beautiful passage of the prophet, &ldquo;In returning and in rest
ye shall be saved!&rdquo;&nbsp; Now when I fail, or when I
wander, too often, instead of quietly returning and resuming my
endeavours, I am apt to sink into myself, and be
discouraged.&nbsp; In short, I seem rather to brood over my
failures than to get pardon for them, and to set about their
amendment.&nbsp; My paper tells me that I cannot enlarge; I must,
therefore, conclude, with the assurance that the best wishes of
Mrs. M. and myself continue to attend yourself and all your
circle.</p>

<p>My dear Armstrong,</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * * * * *</p>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the 9th instant, dear Mrs.
Fletcher was removed from the church militant to the church
triumphant, from a sorrowing church below to a glorious one
above.&nbsp; The last few months of her life were attended with
much pain, but how sweetly did the Christian beam through
all!&nbsp; In her former years she seems to have been called more
particularly to glorify God by an unusual degree of activity and
usefulness.&nbsp; Latterly, she has been called to bear and
suffer; but all in the spirit of her Divine Master.&nbsp; O my
dear <a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
74</span>friend, how gladly would I join her glorified spirit by
making my escape from a world of sin and sorrow!&nbsp; Do not,
however, mistake me; I do, indeed, love home, and strange would
it be were it otherwise, but still I would not run away to get
there.&nbsp; I see that there is much for me still, both to do
and to suffer; and as such, rather than pettishly desiring to
depart, I would calmly and quietly wish to wait&mdash;wait till
all my discipline is over, till I am better fitted and prepared
for my inheritance among the saints in light.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * *</p>
<p>While my Mary&rsquo;s letter lies before me, I feel disposed
to copy another part of it, relative to the management of school
children.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was much pleased a few weeks since at
the national school.&nbsp; Dr. Bell&rsquo;s arrangements are well
made, and the mistress he has appointed is an uncommonly clever
woman, just fit for that situation, and apparently for none
else.&nbsp; I asked her how she managed with the children when
any of them used improper language, having myself been much
troubled with this at our Shoreditch school?&nbsp; She said such
a case rarely occurred, but when it did, she found it better to
convince the understanding of the evil, than merely to correct
for the individual fault; and as she was particular in explaining
the catechism, commandments, &amp;c., she had in general little
trouble in bringing such faults home.&nbsp; For example, she
said, &lsquo;A few days since, about twenty of the girls came to
me, and said, &ldquo;O Governess! little Chambers has said a very
wicked word.&rdquo;&nbsp; I lifted up my hands, and said,
&ldquo;Blessed are the peace makers.&rdquo;&nbsp; If twenty of
you had come to tell me of a good deed, I would gladly have
listened, but go away and be ashamed at being so pleased to
publish the faults of a school-fellow.&nbsp; I thought it right,
however, not to let it go unnoticed; and therefore called to me
privately the monitor of the class.&nbsp; She said,
&ldquo;Indeed, <a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
75</span>governess, it was a very naughty word, it was O
God.&rdquo;&nbsp; I said, &ldquo;Very well, that is
enough.&rdquo;&nbsp; I then went round to the different classes,
who were saying the catechism; after a while I came to this
class, and after having asked several children the commandments,
I said (pointing the fore finger,) &ldquo;Little Chambers, do you
say the third.&rdquo;&nbsp; She immediately burst into tears, and
said, &ldquo;O Governess!&nbsp; I did say a naughty word, but I
will never do so again, if you will forgive me this
once.&rdquo;&rsquo;&nbsp; This is not according to the plan of
correction generally pursued at schools, but it appears to me
much more judicious and more likely to produce lasting
benefit.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>TO HIS SISTER.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Madeley, Jan. 26th, 1816.</p>
<p>My dear Mary,</p>
<p>I <span class="smcap">have</span> been much struck of late
with the forcible manner in which the providence of God has been
co-operating with his word in the endeavour to teach me a lesson,
which, of all others, I find so exceedingly difficult to learn; I
mean that of so numbering my days as to apply my heart unto
wisdom.&nbsp; The removal of my dear mother-in-law, the unusual
number of deaths among all descriptions of persons in my own
immediate neighbourhood, and especially that of Mrs. Fletcher;
all these conspiring circumstances loudly enforce the necessity
of being sober and watching unto prayer, of having my loins girt
<a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>and my
lamp burning, of being in a prepared posture of expectation,
waiting for the coming of my Lord.&nbsp; These effects, I am
thankful to state, have in some measure been gratefully traced by
me in my recent experience.&nbsp; One thing seems to me more than
ever to be truly needful, not indeed the obtaining and the
securing of inheritances below, but the getting prepared for my
inheritance above&mdash;an inheritance to which every day and
every hour spent for God is adding some increase of comfort, and
which, when once possessed, will be found to be worth the
possessing&mdash;an inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, and
which fadeth not away.&nbsp; O my dear Mary, how does the grand
enemy of our souls destroy by deluding! how does he infatuate the
world at large! how gross also the deception which he practises
even upon believers themselves, making then live nine-tenths of
their time, if not sinfully, at least uselessly for themselves,
or for the world, instead of for God and eternity, as a matter of
course, instead of with a pure and single aim.&nbsp; But, alas!
what is any action when stripped of its proper motive, I mean the
glory of God.&nbsp; A man may give liberally to the poor, he may
carefully regulate his household, bring up his children decently
and even morally, and restrain his domestics from immoralities
and inconsistencies.&nbsp; But if our liberality is connected
with our own reputation, if our children be merely educated that
they may bring credit and comfort to us, or if our dependents are
restrained and their good consulted, because it would reflect
dishonour upon us to pursue a contrary course; if these be our
motives, what are they after all but mere selfishness?&nbsp;
There is no reference to God in all these actions, and, of
course, no eternal reward can be expected from them.&nbsp; Their
reference is to ourselves and that also in our present state, but
the future is left entirely out of the question.&nbsp; I grant,
indeed, that a present reward is obtained, <a
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>but this is
all, and, in fact, it is all which in most cases is sought
for.&nbsp; The benevolent man has the reputation for benevolence,
which he seeks; the moral educator of his children has the
satisfaction of seeing them orderly and decent, and they bring to
him the temporal comfort which he desired; the strict and moral
master has in the same way the present fruit of his
labours.&nbsp; But if God&rsquo;s glory, if a sincere desire of
pleasing him, has not been combined with the motives of these
respective individuals, no eternal fruit will be found from
them.&nbsp; They die with this present world.&nbsp; How
uselessly, then, if not sinfully, are the generality of persons
employed, and what need have we all to strive to live more
completely under the influence of unseen celestial
realities!&nbsp; I feel these truths while I am writing them, and
the earnest prayer of my soul is, that, as a consequence of them,
my inheritance may rather be in reserve than in immediate
possession.</p>
<h3>TO THE REV. JOHN ARMSTRONG.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Madeley, Salop. March 4th, 1816.</p>
<p>My dear Armstrong,</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * * * * *</p>
<p><span class="smcap">You</span> may perhaps recollect that in
one of my former letters I mentioned &mdash; as a violent opposer
of everything which had the least appearance of real
godliness.&nbsp; He also has been called from among us, and that
in a manner which of all others seemed most likely to excite
attention, and lead to serious inquiry.&nbsp; O, my dear friend,
what a mercy is it that our feet have not been treading in the
same unhallowed paths!&nbsp; We see in him what we ourselves
should have been, had we been left to ourselves.&nbsp; To the
grace of God&mdash;Arminian as you <a name="page78"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 78</span>conceive me to be&mdash;I am fully
convinced the reason should be ascribed.&nbsp; Dear Mr. &mdash;
bears the afflictive stroke with a union of acute feelings and
perfect resignation, such as is seldom seen.&nbsp; I should have
imagined the stroke would have almost overwhelmed him; but what
cannot the grace of God enable us to bear?</p>
<p>You imagine that now I am fixed at Madeley, I have become more
a Methodist than ever.&nbsp; If by the term you mean an
attachment to their peculiar doctrines, I must confess that you
are not very far from the mark; for I feel more than ever
persuaded that with some slight modification, they are the
truth.&nbsp; The more I pray, and study, and experience, and
preach, the more do I see of their accordancy with the whole
revealed will of God.&nbsp; All seems intelligible, all in
unison.&nbsp; But though more decided than ever, I trust that I
am no bigot.&nbsp; I exclude, I would deal out contemptuous pity
to, no one; and, therefore, God forbid, that I should at any time
lay that stress upon disputed points which should lead my dear
friend to imagine, that because we do not quite see alike, that,
therefore, I feel the least atom of diminution in point of
affection.&nbsp; I can from my heart assure him that it is no
such thing.&nbsp; Should you, however, fancy that by my coming to
Madeley, I am more of a Methodist, because I am less of a
Churchman; in this respect, I feel, then, I can altogether clear
myself.&nbsp; The fact is, the more I see of Methodism, the less
do I admire it.&nbsp; There is that party spirit, that uncommon
wish to proselyte, that settled jealousy against those who are
more successful in their endeavours&mdash;in short, that spirit
which, if suffered to proceed, would completely undermine our
most excellent Establishment, and erect itself in its stead, that
though I cannot but greatly love and admire some of its members,
as a body I dare not give them that countenance or support which
I should do were their doctrines the only point <a
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>in
consideration.&nbsp; I therefore have adopted all that strikes me
as good in their system, but at the same time keep myself and
people perfectly distinct.&nbsp; By this means, I have ill-will
and opposition to an extent which you would hardly conceive; but
I go quietly and lovingly forward, and I thank God my plans have
hitherto well succeeded, and I feel quite convinced that all will
eventually be well.&nbsp; What provokes most opposition, is my
using the same weapons which have so successfully been employed
by themselves, and that with the increased advantage of their
being combined with all the weight of influence connected with
the Establishment.&nbsp; I wish my dear friend would try the same
weapons, and he would soon see the most beneficial effects. * * *

<h3>TO THE REV. JOHN ARMSTRONG.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Madeley, Salop. Aug. 5, 1816.</p>
<p>My dear Armstrong,</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Your</span> two or three last letters, but
more particularly the last of all, seem written under a degree of
depression which I am greatly concerned to observe.&nbsp; While
engaged in doing a great work, while filling an important post,
and that with no small measure of patient perseverance, you
suffer yourself to suppose that you are doing almost
nothing.&nbsp; While your friends which you have left behind you
are admiring the zeal and the love which have enabled you to tear
yourself from the comforts of civilized and refined society, and
thus to forget, as it were, your own <a name="page80"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 80</span>people and your father&rsquo;s house,
while they are thankful for the grace of God within you, you are
so discouragingly comparing yourself with a Schwartz and a Van
der Kemp, as to request of your unworthy friend that he would
pray for you, lest, after all, you should prove a castaway.&nbsp;
Now, my dear Armstrong, what must I say to such feelings and
requests?&nbsp; Must I sympathise with my dear desponding
friend?&nbsp; I do so from my heart; but I must also chide with
him: you overlook the tender mercies of God towards you; you keep
your eye not on the bright side, but on that which is dark,
gloomy, and foreboding; and thus faith and confidence in your
loving and omnipotent Redeemer seem dormant and inactive
principles.&nbsp; But what is the language of the Saviour under
such circumstances of discouragement?&nbsp; It is that which he
addressed to Martha at the grave of Lazarus: &ldquo;Said I not
unto thee, that if thou wouldst believe, thou shouldst see the
glory of God?&rdquo;&nbsp; It is that also which he used towards
the afflicted father, who with tears requested that, if he could
do anything, he would have compassion on him, and help him:
&ldquo;If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that
believeth.&rdquo;&nbsp; Believe then, my dear friend, through all
your difficulties and discouragements, and your temporary
darkness will be succeeded by glorious and abiding light.&nbsp;
The clouds which for a season overspread your horizon will be
dispelled, and your glistening eye will be cheered with a bright
and resplendent day.&nbsp; Perhaps, however, you may tell me,
that faith is the gift of God, and that we must wait till this
hinging blessing be bestowed.&nbsp; But are not all the gifts of
God to be obtained upon the simple condition of asking? and were
you to ask for this gift, or for its increase, would the blessed
God deny it?&nbsp; I have often found it exceedingly useful to my
own mind, after having fallen upon my knees <a
name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>to pray to
that God who has promised to give to us all that we ask in
faith,&mdash;I have found it profitable to ask previously, that
the Lord would give me faith to believe, that the petitions which
I should present before his throne of grace, would be answered by
him, and, as a consequence, my faith has been strengthened far
beyond its usual exercise.&nbsp; And with regard to discouraging
circumstances, my constant prayer has been that my faith might
not fail.&nbsp; Since I came into this parish, I have had
difficulties to encounter, such as some of my dearest friends and
fellow-labourers have confessed that they should not have dared
to meet, and I must acknowledge, that, at times, I have sighed,
and wept, and groaned, being burdened; and have had many a
thought of leaving my arduous post to some more intrepid and
persevering spirit.&nbsp; But something seemed continually to be
whispering to my dejected mind, &ldquo;only believe,&rdquo;
&ldquo;let not your faith fail you,&rdquo; and I blessed God that
through all I was enabled, in some sort, to believe, though not
without many a tremulous assertion, and equally trembling prayer,
&ldquo;Lord, I believe, help thou mine unbelief.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
it is with unfeigned gratitude towards the blessed God, that I
feel it my duty to add, that all my storms have, for the present
at least, completely blown over, and that success has been
vouchsafed to my poor mean insignificant labours, such as my most
sanguine expectations could in no wise have imagined.&nbsp;
Should I not say, then, to my dear friend, as an experimental
result &ldquo;from believing verily to see the goodness of the
Lord in the land of the living,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;O tarry thou
the Lord&rsquo;s leisure, be strong, and he shall comfort thine
heart;&rdquo; &ldquo;Wait, I say, on the Lord&rdquo;?&nbsp; But
here I feel, as usual, that I must check myself.&nbsp; I forget
to whom I am writing, and likewise what I am inditing: I forget
that I am addressing one who has that anointing from above <a
name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>which
teacheth all things, and that I am not composing a sermon, but
scribbling a letter.</p>
<p>I know not whether you were acquainted with S&mdash;, of our
college, and B&mdash;, of Trinity.&nbsp; The former I used
occasionally to meet, and was accustomed to consider him as one
of the very holiest men at college.&nbsp; Since my last letter,
however, he, B&mdash;, and two others, have left the Church,
because they could not read the ten commandments, and are now
preaching all the heights and depths of eternal election, eternal
justification, and eternal sanctification: they have likewise
begun to ordain others, and R&mdash; K&mdash;, the member for
L&mdash;, has vacated his seat, and received ordination from
them.&nbsp; The moderate Calvinists are endeavouring to stop the
growing evil, but I am sorry to say, that among many it is sadly
spreading.&nbsp; It has had one good effect, however; it has made
many of the high men, as they are termed, much more guarded and
circumspect. * * * *</p>
<p>Mary and my brother unite with me in very kindest love to
yourself, and most respectful and affectionate remembrances to
Mrs. A., and I may likewise add, in very best wishes and earnest
prayers for your dear children.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">I remain your very sincere
Friend,</p>

<h3>TO THE REV. JOHN ARMSTRONG.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Madeley, Sept. 30, 1816.</p>
<p>My dear Armstrong,</p>
<p>I <span class="smcap">suppose</span> that you are aware, that,
as resident curate, I am entitled to the use of the
vicarage-house.&nbsp; During Mrs. Fletcher&rsquo;s life, I waved
my claim in her favour: but after her decease, I applied to the
<a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>vicar, and
now that it has been put into pretty extensive repair, we have
taken up our abode in it, and a most holy happy spot we do indeed
find it.&nbsp; In the room where I am now writing, some of my
older parishioners state, that they have frequently taken their
tea with both Mr. and Mrs. F., and well remember the happy
seasons they enjoyed.&nbsp; In the room in which we commonly sit,
they both of them departed in the Lord.&nbsp; In a third chamber,
Mr. F was accustomed to retire for more private and wrestling
prayer, and, as we read in his life, the wall of which was
stained with his breath while importunately pleading.&nbsp;
Another room has the bureau at which he was accustomed to write,
and which, with many other things, he left in his will for the
use of his successors, that the house might not be the worse for
his having had it.&nbsp; In a word, almost every spot and fixture
reminds us pleasingly of those exalted characters who have
preceded us, and call forth many an earnest prayer, and many a
private ejaculation, that those who follow them may drink deeper
and deeper into their blessed spirit, and tread more and more
closely in their pious and spiritual steps.</p>
<p>Dear Mrs. Fletcher once mentioned to us, that one day, shortly
after her coming to Madeley, she remarked to Mr. F., as they were
entering upon their premises, that she did not know how it was,
but that she always felt a measure of divine influence whenever
she entered within the gate.&nbsp; The holy man answered that he
was not surprised to hear her say so, for that there was not a
single brick or a stone in the whole premises which had not been
sanctified by prayer.&nbsp; I feel somewhat in the same way with
Mrs. F&mdash;, and though I am aware that God is everywhere
present, and that all spots may equally share in this his
glorious presence, yet I cannot but think that some places are
privileged beyond others, and though, perhaps, <a
name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>my Honduras
friend may smile at his Madeley enthusiast, yet I must frankly
confess to you, that I consider it as no small privilege that I
dwell in the house, as well as labour in the parish, of one so
peculiarly devoted to God.&nbsp; The days I have already spent
here have been, without any exception, the happiest I have spent
upon earth.&nbsp; Week after week has rolled round in the
peaceful enjoyment of the presence of the blessed God.&nbsp; My
most painful and laborious duties have been not only easy, but a
source of thankfulness and joy far beyond any of my former
experience.&nbsp; In a word, I seem to have known some
<i>little</i>, at least, of what is so beautifully described in
one of my favourite hymns:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Far above all earthly things,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; While yet my hands are here employed;<br />
Sees my soul the King of kings<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And freely talks with God.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pray for me, my dear Armstrong, that these feelings may not be
transitory, but abiding and ever increasing.&nbsp; I too often
rest contented with the mere husks of religion, instead of
feeding on the substantial and the nourishing corn.&nbsp; I am
too generally satisfied with the outward life of the Christian,
the regulation of my conduct, temper, disposition, pursuits, and
so on; while that inward life of God within the soul, that
communion with the Father of spirits and the Son of his love, is
too commonly overlooked.&nbsp; I want a <i>deep work</i> of his
grace within my soul, and this I am now endeavouring in my poor
feeble way to pray for, if so be that I may eventually obtain;
but my unbelieving heart tells me, that I never was cut out for
anything like spirituality.&nbsp; One text of Scripture, however,
still encourages me, &ldquo;This is the will of God even your
sanctification;&rdquo; and therefore though faint, I would still
be persevering.</p>
<p><a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
85</span>To-morrow evening, being the first Tuesday after
quarter-day, our <i>church classes</i> hold their quarterly
meetings for the second time.&nbsp; The first time of their
meeting was a season which will long be remembered by me with
gratitude.&nbsp; My heart quite melted to hear so many declare,
that, under God, they owned their first religious good to my poor
feeble ministrations, and when in the fulness of their hearts
they could not refrain from thanking the good Lord who had
brought me among them.&nbsp; And I felt the more astonished and
thankful inasmuch as I never had a fourth part of the like
success in all the former years put together in which I had been
labouring elsewhere.&nbsp; Oh, what shall I render to the Lord
for all his benefits conferred upon me?&nbsp; I will take the cup
of salvation and call upon the name of the Lord&mdash;still call
upon him for his future help and blessing, for without this I
feel I can do nothing.&nbsp; Our little classes, I am thankful to
state, are gradually increasing.&nbsp; I think we reckon
sixty-seven in all.&nbsp; As to one or two, I feel constrained to
stand in doubt, but the rest I trust are sincere souls.&nbsp;
But, while I thus number my little flock, I feel that there is
necessity to guard against the spirit of David: I endeavour to do
this, and to sink down before God under a continual sense of my
own nothingness; but pride is a subtle enemy, and, as Dr. Watts
so correctly observes,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We cannot make his glories known,<br />
But self-applause creeps in.&rdquo;</p>

<h3><a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>TO HIS
SISTER.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Madeley, May 24, 1817.</p>
<p>My dear Mary,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the course of Mr. Bailey&rsquo;s
attendance upon Mary, we had frequent opportunities of
conversation, and, as I feel desirous of turning the conversation
to those points on which persons feel most capable, as well as
most desirous of talking, we frequently touched upon medical
subjects.&nbsp; One day I told him my fears that both Mary and
myself were consumptive, and that we had often talked about the
possibility of our being removed in this way.&nbsp; He said, in
reply, that Mrs. M&mdash; was not a consumptive subject, at least
he had discovered nothing as yet which led him to suppose it; and
that, with regard to myself, whatever predisposition I might have
had towards it in early life, it had since taken another
course.&nbsp; I wished to know what he meant by its having gone
off in a different channel, even supposing that the
predisposition once existed, when he told me the following
anecdote:&mdash;His father was a medical man and accustomed to
speak his mind without reserve.&nbsp; He used to visit the
C&mdash;s in the place where they then lived, and knowing their
constitutions pretty accurately he used to say, the B&mdash;s
(meaning his own family) will go off into livers, and the
C&mdash;s into lungs, intimating that these disorders would carry
them off.&nbsp; Fanny, however (who was one of the C&mdash;s, and
similarly deformed with myself), he thought, owing to her form
would out-live them all, and escape the family disease.&nbsp; The
B&mdash;s removed from the place, and Mr. B&mdash; having
occasion to go there again after about twenty years&rsquo;
absence, was naturally led to inquire after his old friends, when
he found that all of them, excepting Fanny, had been removed by
consumption, and that she, feeling her <a name="page87"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 87</span>spirits affected by living in the
place where all her family had died, had gone either to London,
or some such place, for society, but was otherwise quite
well.&nbsp; Mr. B&mdash; then told me, that he had no doubt that
this was the case with myself also, and that very many similar
cases had occurred.&nbsp; I had often thought that I could trace
much spiritual benefit as resulting from my bodily form; nay, I
have even been led to thank God for it, conceiving it very
probable that it had been the saving of my soul; but little did I
imagine that it conduced in any way to my bodily comfort, and
that it has probably been the saving of my life.&nbsp; O my dear
sister, how little do we know of the goodness of the Lord towards
the children of men; and how little, with our present imperfect
powers, shall we ever be able to know in this present world; but
what we do know tends to show us in characters written as it were
with a sunbeam, &ldquo;<span class="smcap">He doeth all things
well</span>.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Extracted from a letter to his sister, dated May 17,
1817:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Happy in married life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Should your union, my beloved sister, with Mr. H. prove
to you what mine has with Mary, you will be disposed to consider
with myself that this ordinance is not merely divine, but to be
ranked amongst the foremost of God&rsquo;s gifts to
man.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Extract of a letter, dated June 2, 1817:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;As to myself, I feel that I have increasing
cause for gratitude in all that concerns me.&nbsp; I think I
never felt so truly blessed in any former period of my
life.&nbsp; I really have no earthly desire unfulfilled; my cup
literally runs over.&nbsp; God is also very graciously pleased to
prosper me in my ministerial labours.&nbsp; I have the
satisfaction of seeing fresh trophies of the Redeemer&rsquo;s
power to save; and my heart is rejoiced in seeing those whom the
Lord has <a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
88</span>gathered around me, walking, in some measure at least,
as becometh the Gospel of Christ.&nbsp; To these, indeed, there
are, as there is reason to fear there ever will be, some painful
exceptions; but, upon the whole, I have abundant cause for
thanksgiving and praise.&nbsp; In the midst of all these causes
for joy, I have many a memento that the excellence of the power
is of God, and not of men; the cracked earthen vessel is but too
apparent.&nbsp; For this, however, I hope I feel grateful; for
what is so great a blessing to a poor, proud, selfish being, such
as I am constrained to acknowledge myself, as occasional
humiliations?&nbsp; They are the very medicine of my
soul.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After referring to two cases of affliction in his family, he
writes to his friend abroad, dated August 4, 1817:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;But out of all the Lord has most graciously
delivered us; and I can look back upon the whole with real
gratitude to God.&nbsp; There was not a stroke or a drop too
much; all was merciful in the design, and I hope the benefits
still remain.&nbsp; Tribulation working &lsquo;patience,&rsquo; a
calm waiting upon God.&nbsp; Patience an &lsquo;experience&rsquo;
of his divine support at the time, and an experience of his
eventual deliverance.&nbsp; Experience &lsquo;hope,&rsquo; an
expectation of future help and future deliverance; and this hope
will not make me ashamed.&nbsp; There were times in which I felt
this to be a weary land; but still I found the shadow of a great
Rock, and this shade was truly refreshing to my soul.&nbsp; Oh,
that I could ever there abide!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I mentioned to you that our mutual friend Cox
had the living of Bridgenorth presented to him.&nbsp; He has been
there now some months, but he labours under very great
discouragement, owing to the little effect resulting from his
ministrations.&nbsp; A few weeks ago he wished that we should
exchange duties, hoping that my Methodistical zeal might arouse
<a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
89</span>them.&nbsp; After an enumeration of the probable
consequences to which he must make up his mind, I at length
consented, and, as I supposed, the stir has been great; rascal,
villain, ranter, field preacher, are the usual epithets attached
to my opprobrious name.&nbsp; A petition has been drawn up, with
many signatures attached, requesting Cox to forbid me his pulpit;
in short, the whole place has been in a hubbub.&nbsp; Inquiry,
however, begins to take place, the stagnant waters are moved, and
after the working off of the scum and the grosser particles, we
may expect to see purer and even living waters.&nbsp; Cox
answered their petition with becoming spirit, united with
pleasing conciliation.&nbsp; It has, I find, given great offence,
notwithstanding all; but we wait for the issue in a spirit of
prayer.&nbsp; It is somewhat remarkable that Bridgenorth was the
place in which Richard Baxter, author of the &ldquo;Saint&rsquo;s
Rest,&rdquo; met with such decided opposition, that as he went
out of the town, he shook off the dust of his feet as a testimony
against them; and, since that time, no preached gospel has
prospered among them.&nbsp; The Dissenters and even the
warm-hearted Methodists have hitherto laboured almost in
vain.&nbsp; But who knows how soon the curse may be
removed?&nbsp; We keep encouraging Cox all that we possibly can,
but he seems determined at present to leave.&nbsp; Unite your
prayers, my dear friend, with ours, that he may not be permitted
to desert this wilderness and solitary place, but that he may
patiently wait till he rejoices over it as a peculiarly verdant
spot in the garden of our Lord.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>TO HIS SISTER.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Madeley, 21st Nov. 1817.</p>
<p>My dear Mary,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> case of conscience with which
your letter begins is such as would puzzle a much more expert
casuist <a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
90</span>than I ever expect to be; and, therefore, after reading
all that you have written upon the subject, as explanatory of
your views and feelings, I feel more disposed to commend you in
prayer to the teachings of God&rsquo;s most Holy Spirit, than
attempt to darken counsel by words without knowledge.&nbsp; I am
sensible, however, that this may originate in an unwillingness to
meet a difficulty from a consciousness of the scantiness of my
spiritual information, and from a fear of the consequent poor
opinion you might entertain of me for my want of success, I will,
therefore, hazard a few remarks.&nbsp; It has always struck me
that the creature occupies an improper place when we consider it
in any way essential to our good, when we fancy that there is any
absolute and positive necessity for the presence of any one thing
in order to constitute us happy.&nbsp; It was God&rsquo;s
declaration to Abraham, &ldquo;I am the Almighty [<i>the
all-sufficient</i>] God; walk before me, and be thou
perfect.&rdquo;&nbsp; And St. Paul so fully realized this, that
he lived, as it were, completely independent of the creature; he
found his God an all-sufficient portion, quite adequate of
himself to satisfy the largest desires of his soul.&nbsp; He
could, therefore, <i>take pleasure</i> in infirmities, in
reproaches, in necessities, &amp;c.; for he experimentally found
that, as his afflictions abounded, his consolations did much more
abound.&nbsp; In a word, he discovered in his God a happiness
which was not merely independent of the creature, but which
flourished and abounded under circumstances most likely to
interrupt or destroy it.&nbsp; The fact is, that the creature is
only an <i>arbitrary channel</i>, the pipe, if I may so speak,
which a God of love has been pleased to choose, in order to
convey his benefits.&nbsp; The pipe is neither the benefit, nor
the source; and, of course, though it is conducive to our
comfort, though it may in many respects be <i>subservient</i> to
our welfare, yet it is by no means <i>essentially necessary</i>,
<a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>for God is
the God of all consolation, whether intermediately or immediately
conveyed, and should He, on any occasion, see fit to remove the
medium, the same and even more abounding happiness <i>may</i> be
received immediately from Himself; and since God is infinite in
his wisdom and in his love, this <i>will</i> be so, provided it
be for our good.&nbsp; And if we need not the former quantum of
happiness, if it would prove injurious to us, is it not a mercy
that it should be denied?&nbsp; But perhaps you will ask, How are
we to know whether we love the creature too much or not?&nbsp;
How is it to be ascertained whether we regard it as essential to
our good, or merely subservient to it?&nbsp; This may be
ascertained in two ways&mdash;1st, How do we feel when our
channels are removed?&nbsp; Does it seem as though our all were
gone?&nbsp; If after a prop has been removed from under us, we
immediately fall, it is evident that our <i>whole weight</i> has
been placed upon it; if we stagger and stumble, though by
dexterity we may recover ourselves, and not actually fall, yet we
show that <i>too much</i> of our weight was resting on it; but
if, after its removal, we stand upright as before, it is
manifest, as Archbishop Leighton observes, that we have been
leaning not on our prop, but on an invisible arm for
support.&nbsp; The application is easy.&nbsp; But I suggested
another means of ascertaining the same point.&nbsp; What are our
feelings under any probable expectations of the removal of our
channel?&nbsp; This, however, is so closely allied with the
former that it needs no separate enlargement or
elucidation.&nbsp; It is evident that the man who is filled with
alarm at the bare idea of the removal of his gold, is too much in
love with it, and, more or less, is making it his god.&nbsp; And
he who, with more specious refinement of taste, dreads the
interruption of his social pleasures, or the removal of some of
his wonted sources of good, follows but too closely in the same
steps.&nbsp; God must be <a name="page92"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 92</span>owned and felt as our all in
all.&nbsp; He must be regarded, not merely as our <i>supreme</i>
good, but as our only good, as that which is <i>alone</i>
necessary.&nbsp; In a word, all I have to say is summed up in
those two expressive lines in the Methodist hymn-book,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Lead me where I my heaven may find,<br />
The heaven of loving Thee alone.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>About the end of the year 1817, Mr. Mortimer entertained
serious thoughts of going out to New Zealand as a missionary, and
for this end corresponded with the secretary of the &ldquo;Church
Missionary Society&rdquo; on the subject; and it so happened that
about this time also two New Zealand chiefs, Tooi and Teterree,
arrived in England, and it was proposed that they should abide
for awhile at Madeley, which they accordingly did.&nbsp; The
providence of God, however, did not seem to open his way for
removing to a far-distant land, and he acquiesced in the result
with his usual loving submission to the will of God.&nbsp; The
following letter to the writer gives some account of the way by
which he was led to contemplate the step referred to:&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Madeley, Nov. 26th, 1817.</p>
<p>My dear Armstrong,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Many</span> incidents have occurred since
it has pleased God to separate us, in which I should have
regarded it as an exceedingly great comfort to my mind could I
have consulted you, and obtained from you either your veto or
procedas; but I think that I never felt the want of it more than
at present.&nbsp; I hardly know whether I ought to puzzle you
with a long detail, pro and con., of what has of late been
passing in my mind, or to wait till I come to some
conclusion.&nbsp; But as I <a name="page93"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 93</span>feel that I should unbosom my mind to
you in the fullest freest manner, were you now sitting by my
side, I will use the same freedom, though you are at a
distance.&nbsp; You must know, then, that I have lately been
exerting myself among my parishioners on behalf of the Church
Missionary Society, have read in my different exposition-rooms
the very interesting accounts published in their quarterly papers
and missionary registers, and, to make myself somewhat master of
the matters upon which I spoke, I began to go regularly through
the whole of the volumes which they have hitherto
published.&nbsp; A great sensation has been excited among my
people.&nbsp; I thought we should do exceedingly little; but God
has opened the hearts of my people, and I rejoice in the
event.&nbsp; This, however, is not the only effect which has been
produced.&nbsp; My own heart has been so completely won over to
the missionary cause that I am inclined to think, I shall not
easily be persuaded to remain quietly and cozily at home, while
so much remains to be done abroad.&nbsp; The call to continue
here must be much stronger than it has hitherto been, or my
struggling spirit will be found to burst its ties and make its
escape to more needed labours.&nbsp; I trust I shall not force my
way; this, under no circumstances, can be desirable, but I think
that hitherto my mind has leaned too much one way, and has been
too ready to interpret the suggestions of some, and the
oppositions of others, into providential intimations of its being
the will of God, to hesitate and eventually to abandon my object;
but now I feel very differently.&nbsp; In the spirit of
sacrifice, with our lives in our hands, and almost our all of
earthly good at stake, we shall hold ourselves ready to proceed
whenever we can with any consistency make our escape.&nbsp; You
will ask, perhaps, what are our plans?&nbsp; I have often thought
of joining my very very dear friends at Honduras, but the
unhealthiness of the climate, and the stings of <a
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>your
musquitos quite deter my good wife, and she shrinks from your
shore with feelings which I dare not any further attempt to
correct.&nbsp; To speak honestly, I fear your climate would soon
bring her to her grave, and therefore I should not think myself
at all authorized to press the point further than I have already
done.&nbsp; New Zealand is the place which we have in our minds,
and though the inhabitants are cannibals, and though the ill
treatment of the Europeans has exasperated them to a degree of
determined retaliation, which might deter the mere worldly
calculators from venturing to settle among them; yet as we trust
that the spirit of love and kindness will ever actuate us in our
intercourse with them, we trust likewise that our gracious God
will become a wall of fire round about us to keep them from
injuring us.&nbsp; A very amiable, interesting, and truly pious
young man, who has lately been through college, and is now
waiting till he becomes of age for orders, has fully made up his
mind to join us so soon as his friends can be persuaded to part
with him.&nbsp; Ever since I have been in the parish the Lord has
been pleased to knit his heart to me in a very singular
way.&nbsp; His mind has been turned to New Zealand for nearly
three years.</p>
<p>The whole circle of my friends, together with myself, feel
much obliged to you for your communications to Mr. Pratt, which
he has published in the last <i>Missionary Register</i>, October,
1817.&nbsp; They greatly interested us, and we could not help
rejoicing in all the good which the good Lord is effecting
through you.&nbsp; May all this be only the promise of a more
abundant shower.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Letters passed at sea some time about the beginning of this
year, between Mr. Mortimer and the editor, each asking, without
knowing the intention of the other, that his friend would become
sponsor for <a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
95</span>his next-born child&mdash;a circumstance which explains
the allusions made to the subject, in the three following
extracts:&mdash;</p>
<h3>TO THE REV. JOHN ARMSTRONG.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Madeley, June 1, 1818.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> honour which my dear friends
have conferred upon my unworthy name affected me greatly, and the
more so, as within three or four weeks of the time your letter
reached me, two other similar instances of the very great
affection of my friends here had occurred.&nbsp; Unknown to me,
many of them put their contributions together, and forwarded them
to the Church Missionary Society, for the support of two African
children, to be named after myself and my dear Mary; and a young
man among the Quakers, to whom the Lord has made me (his most
unworthy servant) a channel of good, has likewise taken my
name.&nbsp; What shall I say to these tokens of love?&nbsp; I
know not what to say&mdash;but that I am ashamed and confounded
before God, to think that any mark of love and respect should be
shown to me whom <i>He</i> sees as so abject and polluted; and as
to my dear friends, all I can say is, the Lord reward them a
thousand fold for all that their hearts contrive, and their
loving conduct so fully expresses.</p>
<h3>TO THE REV. THOS. MORTIMER.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Madeley, near Shiffnal, July 20,
1818.</p>
<p>My dear Thomas,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> think of naming the dear little
one Ph&oelig;be, a name much endeared to us, as borne by one dear
relation now no more, and by another still reserved <a
name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>to us, whom
we sincerely love.&nbsp; It is a name likewise which has not as
yet been introduced among us.&nbsp; We were thinking of joy and
gladness, but this we have left to be, as we hope, long enjoyed
by one already in our family, and to be in reserve in case it
should be wanted for another, on whom we should rejoice to see
even an equal portion of her parents&rsquo; spirit.&nbsp; A
servant of the church is what we claim for our little one, and
may the claim be abundantly realized!</p>
<p>If Mrs. T. M. would not object to become one of the sponsors
for our little girl, and would permit us to employ some one as
her proxy, we should feel ourselves much obliged by her
compliance.&nbsp; My dear Honduras friend has kindly consented to
take upon him this charge for one, and we purpose applying to Mr.
John Eyton, as the third.&nbsp; Perhaps you will be so good as
drop me an early line, and thus set me an example I so much
need.</p>
<h3>TO THE REV. JOHN ARMSTRONG.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Madeley, Aug. 3, 1818.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">With</span> regard to myself I have
nothing to write to you but a continued series of failure and
disappointment; and, if I might speak of the future from the
present, I should say, that the Lord is calling me to remain at
home rather than to go anywhere abroad.&nbsp; The state of the
case is simply this:&mdash;When first I proposed myself as the
servant of the Missionary Society, I did not apprehend anything
like difficulty with regard to a supply for Madeley&mdash;the
vicar, who is not resident, had always consulted the wishes of
the people, and had given them the choice of their
minister.&nbsp; No sooner, however, was it known by him that I
had some thoughts of leaving, than he <a name="page97"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 97</span>declared, in the most positive terms,
that he would not admit to a curacy a person of my recommending,
and he quite wondered that I should ever think he would, or, in
other words, he did not intend to have a person of my
stamp.&nbsp; It soon, however, occurred to me, that if an
application were made in behalf of my young but very dear friend,
&mdash; &mdash;, the vicar would, for the sake of his father,
permit him to succeed me: this he in fact promised, but when he
found out that the son was of a different stamp from the father,
and that the wrong kind of person was thus most unintentionally
selected, he drew back and would not take another step; and Mr.
&mdash;, hurt at the whole procedure, declares that he will not,
upon any consideration whatever, make another application, and
thus matters are completely in <i>statu quo</i>.&nbsp; I dare not
leave my people to an ungodly successor, and therefore the
present intimation seems to be, &ldquo;stand still.&rdquo;&nbsp;
I feel it a time of suspense, but I am quite persuaded that all
is in the very best hands, and of course that all will be sweetly
ordered for good.&nbsp; I need not request you to pray for us; I
am assured of your love, and love will necessarily lead you to a
throne of grace on our behalf.</p>
<p>About a fortnight ago my dear Mary was confined, and safely
delivered of a little girl, whom we purpose naming Ph&oelig;be,
and may God grant she may prove a servant of the church, as that
honoured individual whose name stands prominently distinguished
in the Word of God&mdash;not, indeed, by becoming a lady
preacher, as you designated Mrs. F&mdash;, in one of your
letters, but in such a way as is becoming her sex; and in how
many blessed ways this is possible we shall neither of us be at a
loss to determine.&nbsp; We purpose availing ourselves of your
kind permission to employ you as one of the sponsors, and we feel
ourselves much, very much obliged by your compliance with our
wishes.&nbsp; <a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
98</span>Indeed, everything which seems like bringing us nearer
together affords us a degree of pleasure we cannot easily
express.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The humility of my beloved friend was not only deep but
uniform, and it was also most unfeigned.&nbsp; I believe no
sentiments conveyed in his letters with regard to himself were
more sincerely the utterance of his heart, than such as appear in
the two following extracts; and a savour of which, indeed, runs
more or less, through all his correspondence.</p>
<h3>TO THE REV. JOHN ARMSTRONG.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Madeley, Oct. 5, 1818.</p>
<p>My dear Armstrong,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Yours</span> of the 8th of August reached
me yesterday evening, and afforded me much refreshment of spirit
after the labours of the day, as your kind and interesting
communications almost invariably do; but if they sometimes may
fail in imparting refreshment, they are never wanting in interest
and in solid instruction.&nbsp; The only effect sometimes
produced, is in deeply humbling me, in abasing me before my
friends, and in the presence of my God.&nbsp; I feel myself so
wretched a sinner, and so completely unworthy of your least
notice.&nbsp; Indeed, I sometimes think that if you could but see
me instead of hearing from me&mdash;could we but renew our
personal acquaintance&mdash;you would detect in me such evils as
would almost make you ashamed of acknowledging me.&nbsp; In my
letters, hurried as they generally are, you see me under assumed
appearances.&nbsp; I step a little out of myself, sentiments are
expressed, prayers and wishes are breathed forth, and statements
likewise made, which are so very very far from being <a
name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>habitual,
that you can know but little of me in this way.&nbsp; Were you
actually to know me, even all the joy of meeting an old friend
would soon give way to some such exclamation as that uttered by
&AElig;neas at the sight of Hector, &ldquo;Oh quantum mutatus ab
illo.&rdquo;&nbsp; I thus write in consequence of the first
paragraph in your letter, in which you speak of having looked
over some old letters of mine.&nbsp; The reflections in which
this re-perusal made you indulge quite startled me as I read
them, and I cannot but still think that no small measure of
hypocrisy must attach to my character, if my communications do
really convey such sentiments to your mind as those which you
express; for I dare not withhold from you the humbling confession
that, gratified and thankful as I should be for the discovery, I
cannot perceive the impress of truth on any of them.&nbsp; But I
fear I shall tire as well as disgust you with so much about self,
and therefore turn to some other subject.</p>
<h3>TO THE SAME.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Madeley, December 29, 1818.</p>
<p>My dear Armstrong,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">With</span> respect to myself, I can say
but little, excepting what must tend to humble me in the dust
before the Lord and my fellow men.&nbsp; I am still stationary
here, and from all that has transpired, both within and without,
I feel now convinced that whatever the duty of others may be,
mine is to remain at home; and, I think, I shall not easily be
induced to make any further effort to make my escape.&nbsp; I am
now quite content to remain quiet here, and while set aside by
the Lord, as an instrument in whom he has no such pleasure, can
adore him for the greatness of his <a name="page100"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 100</span>tender compassions, which intervened
as an effectual barrier, and kept me from bringing chastisement
upon myself and my family for my presumptuous folly, in thinking
of stretching out my unhallowed hand in supporting a cause,
which, perhaps, I should only have touched, to have impressed on
it a mark of indelible disgrace.</p>
<p>But amidst these feelings which humble me in the dust, and
even confound me before the Lord, I still find him most
graciously condescending to visit me, and still perceive abundant
tokens of his love in my parish, and in my family.&nbsp; All
seems to wear a cheerful and exhilarating smile, and if ever I
was convinced that my being hindered in my plans was from the
Lord, I think it is now.&nbsp; The affection manifested by all
classes among my dear people, when it was known that I had given
up the idea of leaving them, was such as will long be remembered
by me with gratitude towards my kind and loving God: for it is
He, and He alone, who can thus give us the hearts of our
people.&nbsp; O, may I serve in the Gospel of his Son more
faithfully than I have hitherto done!</p>
<h3>TO THE SAME.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Madeley, February 26, 1819.</p>
<p>My dear Armstrong,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">If</span> I recollect right, I just
alluded in my last to the very striking and unexpected change
which has taken place in my brother &mdash;.&nbsp; The more I
think of it the more am I filled with astonishment and
gratitude.&nbsp; Had I been required to select an individual,
which, in my estimation, was the least likely to become a trophy
to the powerful grace of our Redeemer, &mdash; would have been
the person <a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
101</span>upon whom I should have fixed.&nbsp; The grace,
however, of his so long despised Lord has at length triumphed,
and he now delights to build up the faith which he once so
malignantly endeavoured to destroy.</p>
<p>You will readily conceive that I have derived no small
encouragement from these dealings of my gracious God with my dear
brother.&nbsp; But the encouragement has been greatly increased
by the change which has recently passed upon dear Tooi, one of my
New Zealand guests.&nbsp; After they had set sail for New South
Wales, in the <i>Baring</i>, the ship struck against a brake, and
they were obliged to put again into port.&nbsp; During this
interval, Tooi was taken dangerously ill, and, in the estimation
of all who saw him, had not the least probability of
recovery.&nbsp; This painful visitation, however, to his poor
body, seems to have been the means of salvation to his
soul.&nbsp; All the pious friends who surround him, speak of the
change as most unequivocal; and Mr. Hall, who attended them while
with me, and who is as far, as any one I know, from attempting to
colour, speaks in decided terms of the divine change which he has
experienced.&nbsp; Among other things in one of his letters,
writing of Tooi, he says, &ldquo;I cannot help mentioning one of
his simple speeches, which I think will please you. &lsquo;When I
in New South Wales my heart no good: I come to England, and hear
the word of God, and, I think, O dear me, I want a new heart; I
begin to pray to Jesus to give me a new heart.&nbsp; In my own
country, I sin very much, and, when in South seaman, the sailors
teach me to curse and swear&mdash;miserable work.&nbsp; But the
blood of Jesus runs down my heart, and washes away my sins, and
my heart feel comfortable and happy, and I no fear to die.&nbsp;
Believe in Jesus is the way to go up to heaven, and be happy for
ever with Jesus, and all Christian friends; (naming many, and you
and your&rsquo;s amongst the number).&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; O, my
dear friend, how blessed is <a name="page102"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 102</span>true religion, and how touching is
this simple account, which shows, I think, that dear Tooi has
become possessed of it.</p>
<h3>TO THE SAME.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Madeley, May 3, 1819.</p>
<p>My dear Armstrong,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Since</span> I last wrote to you, I have
been called to pass through some painful and unexpected
scenes.&nbsp; About twelve months ago my dear father began to
decline very rapidly in his health, owing to some serious
reverses which he experienced in his temporal concerns, and which
preyed very much upon his mind; the full extent we are none of us
able to determine, but one of my uncles and his son who were
privy to many of his transactions, can distinctly reckon up
&pound;75,000 which came under their own observation.&nbsp; All
these losses had their measure of effect upon his spirits; but,
there was a lawsuit pending, and which had been commenced some
months since, which, if determined against him, threatened to
sweep away all that remained, and even to leave him
insolvent.&nbsp; Of this he informed no one, but kept it working
secretly within, till, at length, it proved too much for him, and
his constitution irrecoverably gave way.&nbsp; On the day of his
removal, indeed, he was unusually well; was out in the garden a
great part of the forenoon, and very cheerful while taking his
tea, but about seven in the evening he was seized with a fit of
apoplexy, and he was a corpse by a little after nine.&nbsp; His
death much affected me, and especially as I had my fears lest it
should have been produced by a mere sorrow of the world; but when
I joined my dear mother, I was much comforted by finding that the
Lord&rsquo;s gracious intentions in all this <a
name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>apparently
severe discipline, were mercifully answered; that they produced
in him a gradual weaning from the world, and an increased esteem
and relish for the things which concerned his soul.&nbsp; And in
this effect, I hope, that we are all, at least most of us,
enabled to rejoice, though, in order to produce it, it was
necessary that he should suffer the loss of almost all
things.&nbsp; To think of his departed spirit, as happy with the
Lord, affords to us a balm of consolation which thousands upon
thousands could not effect without it.</p>
<p>But amidst all this wreck and ruin of property which I have
gradually been called to witness, what abundant cause have I for
gratitude that it has not come nigh me.&nbsp; How graciously has
God been pleased to provide for me and mine!&nbsp; For though my
family is large, and its wants are continually increasing, yet I
have all and abound.&nbsp; I have ever yet had enough, and a
little annually to spare; and I have no doubt but that, with a
little frugality, I shall be able to put by a little more towards
the settling of my dear children when they shall come of
age.&nbsp; Had I known of the present posture of affairs, I might
have done a little more for them, but I am very thankful that I
have done what I have.&nbsp; And may the God of love so regulate
my conduct for the future, that I may never, in any instance,
unnecessarily encroach upon their due; for I feel the force of
the apostolic observation: &ldquo;He that provideth not for his
own,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>

<p>The following is a deeply affecting letter; but, like many of
David&rsquo;s Psalms, if it begins in complainings, it ends in
praises.</p>
<h3><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>TO
THE SAME.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Madeley, July 3, 1819.</p>
<p>My dear Armstrong,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">As</span> to myself, I can say but little:
I seem to be more of a loitering formalist than anything
else.&nbsp; Many things which I began when I first entered upon
my charge here have gradually dwindled into the merest nothings,
and these have at length been given up.&nbsp; And most of those
which are still continued seem to have lost that interest and
power with which they were once accompanied.&nbsp; As to my own
feelings and conduct in the midst of all, they are my shame and
constant humiliation.&nbsp; I am so accustomed to see this
gradual deterioration in many instances, that I almost invariably
expect it in all others, and this makes me less earnest in prayer
and less zealous in action.&nbsp; In all the coldness of apathy,
I seem anticipating nothing but eventual failure in everything;
and then, when nothing further is to be done here, I as coldly
anticipate a removal to some other scene, where similar efforts
will be productive of similar results.&nbsp; These, my dear A.,
have been my general feelings for some months past.&nbsp; I have
often paused to analyze my spirit and my conduct: sometimes I
have been ready to imagine that my indifference argued a deadness
to popularity and applause, and that while I was so content that
others should see that I was nothing, I was gaining some increase
of humility, and, of course, was making some little advancement
in the Divine life.&nbsp; But within these few days, I have been
awakened from my sleep of carnal security, and have been deeply
humbled before my God on account of it.&nbsp; I see that, instead
of stemming the torrent, I have too criminally suffered it to
spread, till it has threatened <a name="page105"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 105</span>ruin to all the plain below.&nbsp;
Instead of propping I have rather undermined the tottering
fabric, and thus aided the natural decay from time and
seasons.&nbsp; Had spirituality been cherished in my own
soul&mdash;had patient self-denying labours been uniformly
pursued&mdash;had ardent believing prayer been constantly
offered&mdash;who can tell how much this tendency to deteriorate
might have been counteracted?&nbsp; Who can tell, rather, what
increase of prosperity might have now called forth my grateful
praise?&nbsp; My motto, therefore, has now become that of the
cheerful, believing and animated Apostle St. Paul.&nbsp; It is
said of him, &ldquo;He thanked God and took courage.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Instead of dejectedly witnessing this natural process, and as
despondingly anticipating still more and more, I feel, through
the grace of my Saviour, enabled thankfully to adore him for all
the good which yet remains; and, with a measure of cheerful
courage, to devote myself to my future work.&nbsp; And I cannot
tell you the sweet peace which has been imparted to my
distrusting mind, and the animated glow which has been diffused
through my cold and apathetical heart; but to think that this
blessed peace and love should have so long been strangers within
my breast, is cause of my humiliation before my compassionate
Redeemer.&nbsp; May my endeared friend never have similar cause
of complaint!</p>
<h3>TO HIS SISTER.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Madeley, Oct. 4, 1819.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My</span> last informed you of the seeming
health of our dear little Basil: on Monday last, we availed
ourselves of a favourable opportunity of having him christened,
and we all thought that, though a little fallen away, he was
looking very well.&nbsp; On Wednesday, <a
name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>however, he
was attacked with infantine cholera morbus, and on the morning of
yesterday his happy spirit burst its way to God.&nbsp; To us,
indeed, the scene was very affecting; it was the first inroad
death had been permitted to make among us, and his entrance
spread a degree of awe upon our minds such as we had not known
before.&nbsp; The strong feelings of affection likewise, and
numerous endearing recollections, kept making us weep till, like
David and his men, we seemed to have no more power to weep, and
even all the grateful expressions which kept bursting from our
thankful hearts, could only be uttered amidst our quickly flowing
tears.&nbsp; These stronger feelings, however, have now somewhat
subsided, and a holy calm of gratitude has regained its seats
within our breasts: our dear little one has, indeed, fled from
among us, but he has fled to a far happier place&mdash;fled to
the arms and bosom of his ever-to-be-adored Redeemer; and oh! how
quick, as well as blessed, the transition!</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We scarce can say he&rsquo;s gone,<br />
Before his happy spirit takes<br />
Its station near the throne.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To-morrow, we think of committing his dear remains to the
silent tomb.&nbsp; I have been selecting and marking out a
suitable spot to be employed, should we continue here, for the
successive members of our family, as they may be called from
among us, and my prayer has been ascending to my blessed Redeemer
that we may every one of us leave as firm a persuasion behind us
of the safety of our eternal state, as our dear little Basil
has.&nbsp; And, indeed, his removal has given me an increased
confidence that this will be the case; for our united prayers for
our dear children have ever been, that they might either live a
holy life, or die an early death.&nbsp; My dear wife, though
weak, is very mercifully supported in the <a
name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>season of
our trial; she feels, and that at times very sensibly, but
peaceful gratitude is still her constant companion: I say
gratitude; for it is not mere submission, it is the peaceful
grateful adoration of that gracious God who is too wise to err,
too good to be unkind; and I am very thankful for all the support
and consolation which our kind Saviour so mercifully affords
her.&nbsp; I think of having a small head stone for my little
boy, mentioning his name, the day of his death and his age, and,
underneath, the following lines which I put down in my pocket
book when you and I were at Enfield, little, indeed, imagining at
the time that I should ever have a dear child of my own over
whose grave they would be inscribed:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;On Life&rsquo;s wide Ocean sorrowful and
pained,<br />
How many Voyagers their course perform;<br />
This little bark a kinder fate obtained,<br />
It reached the Haven ere it met the storm.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Mr. Mortimer very kindly received the writer&rsquo;s son
William (now a clergyman, and British chaplain at Valparaiso, in
South America) into his family, to be educated with his own
children, and it is to this child that allusion is made in the
following letter addressed to him.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Madeley, February 28, 1820.</p>
<p>My dear Armstrong,</p>
<p>I <span class="smcap">have</span> entered into these details,
conceiving that no communication can be more interesting to a
father than those which concern an endeared child; and happy
shall I be if all my future communications be equally
pleasing.&nbsp; Of this, however, I have but little
expectations.&nbsp; Many and very painful fluctuations have I
witnessed in my own children, and have heard of the children of
others, and therefore my dear friend must not be surprised if my
little charge should at <a name="page108"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 108</span>times disappoint our expectations or
our wishes.&nbsp; Oh what lovely, what heavenly blossoms have I
sometimes delightfully discovered in my eldest little boy!&nbsp;
He has seemed even ripening for glory, and that also so rapidly,
that we have almost imagined that his stay would not be long
among us.&nbsp; Tears of gratitude have stood in our eyes while
we have seen the gracious evidences, or while we have been
relating them to each other.&nbsp; In a few weeks, however, the
blossoms and the fruit have almost totally disappeared, and have
left us to sorrow in temporary disappointment, or to find comfort
only in the cheering exhilaration of hope.&nbsp; Then, again, the
winter has passed, and lovely spring has once more
appeared.&nbsp; But it is all well; the harvest of none of our
labours is to be expected here; it is in that blessed world above
that we shall reap, provided that we faint not; and what greater
stimulus can we need to keep urging us forward even in the midst
of every species of discouragement?</p>
<p>William told me a few evenings ago that Mrs. Armstrong had
received a letter from you, which kept her in doubt as to whether
you would join her, or she you.&nbsp; I know so little of what
would be for the best, that I would not attempt to influence you
in one way or other.&nbsp; The greatest benefit which I can
confer on my endeared friend is, to bring him and his concerns to
One who loves him infinitely more than I can do, and whose
infallible direction is promised in his holy word to the
inquiring soul.&nbsp; It was the prayer of my kind friends, I am
persuaded, which kept me in England when I had felt it my duty to
take even most decided measures for leaving it.&nbsp; When they
objected to my step, I almost invariably requested them to pray
for providential hindrances, if my intentions were not in the
divine order; and I told them, if I knew anything of myself, I
should not attempt either to break through <a
name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>the hedge,
or to overleap the wall.&nbsp; The kind Saviour heard their
prayer, and I have never been so fully persuaded of anything as
of this, that my being detained in England was completely of the
Lord.&nbsp; Should my dear Armstrong be projecting that which is
not in the will and order of his God, may the same merciful
Saviour hedge up his way, and plant the piercing thorn at every
step, to render his progress painful, and eventually to deter
him!&nbsp; But should his removal be from God, then may all
difficulties and impediments vanish completely from before
him!</p>
<p>Mary joins me in kind love to yourself and Mr. Ditcher, and I
remain,</p>
<p style="text-align: center">My ever dear Friend,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Yours very affectionately,<br />
G. <span class="smcap">Mortimer</span>.</p>
<h3>TO THE REV. THOMAS MORTIMER.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Madeley, Dec. 22, 1820.</p>
<p>My dear Brother,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have named our little boy
Herbert, after our old and mutual friend; and happy, indeed,
should we think ourselves were he even in some small degree to
resemble that saintly man.&nbsp; I give you his name, with the
hope of its being inserted in your list of those whom you
remember in your hours of intercession; and in the hope,
likewise, that he will not be forgotten by your dear wife.&nbsp;
He seems unusually well at present, better, we think, than any of
our children have been at his age.&nbsp; The suddenness, however,
both of the indisposition and removal of our little Basil, has
made us consider the health and life of an infant as exceedingly
uncertain in its tenure; and we hope we are enabled to leave him
<a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
110</span>completely in the best of hands.&nbsp; You may perhaps
have heard, through Eliza, of the removal of dear Mr. Purton: you
know his worth, his strong attachment to myself, and the right
hand he was to me in everything in which I could in any way use
him, and, therefore, are prepared to suppose what a loss has been
sustained by myself and others.&nbsp; I do not like funeral
sermons in general, but I thought I ought to take up my cross on
such an occasion, and endeavour to hold up his uncommon,
unobtrusive, and retiring excellence to the view of others, and
then, at the same time, pay my own tribute of friendship which I
felt I myself owed to him.</p>
<p>In parochial matters, and in my ministerial concerns, we go on
much as usual.&nbsp; Mr. Purton&rsquo;s removal has put some
extra burdens upon me, but they are not as yet too oppressive,
and, if they should become so, the Lord, I doubt not, will give
me some one who will share them with me.&nbsp; Attendance on
church classes and expositions, nearly in <i>statu quo</i>; and
this, considering the tendency in everything to deteriorate, I
consider as rather encouraging than otherwise.&nbsp; Our good
friends and fellow-helpers, the Methodists, however, seem to be
more prosperous than ourselves.&nbsp; The chapel at the Green has
just been considerably enlarged, and there is some talk of its
being opened in church hours, morning as well as evening, and
some rumours of sacraments and christenings are now and then
reaching my ears.&nbsp; As to myself, I dare say nothing: I am
rather disposed to think that the morning service would be a
benefit to the parish in inducing many poor to attend, who,
through shame or idleness, would not come so far as to the
church; and, as they are my parishioners, I hope I should rejoice
in their good, though this good should not be conveyed through
myself.&nbsp; The sacrament and christenings, in the present
state of Methodism, follow almost as <a name="page111"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 111</span>a matter of course, and therefore I
am equally silent on this subject.&nbsp; All these things were
not the original intention of the founder; but were I a Methodist
myself, I do not know but that I should consider them as
expedient, and almost as necessary parts of present Methodism:
why then should I feel on these accounts?&nbsp; They are doing a
great work.&nbsp; I find them most important auxiliaries in my
own parish, and do sincerely wish them all that prosperity which,
for their works&rsquo; sake, they deserve.&nbsp; A few months
ago, I began to pray for them, and have continued at stated times
ever since; and though I never reckoned myself exceedingly stiff
in my Churchmanship, I am certainly less so now than
before.&nbsp; God permits, and, not only so, he most evidently
owns and blesses; and why should we feel the spirit of Joshua,
and pettishly, or enviously, or selfishly wish to forbid
them?</p>
<h3>TO THE REV. J. ARMSTRONG.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Madeley, Dec. 27, 1820.</p>
<p>My dear Friend,</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * * * * *</p>
<p>I <span class="smcap">was</span> very glad to hear, through my
sister, of your servant Lucy, who came over for Mrs. A&mdash;
&mdash;, whom she saw at Mrs. W. A.&mdash;&rsquo;s; she spoke of
you in the most affectionate terms, and described, in her simple
but strong manner, the change which had been effected in the
settlement through your ministry among them.&nbsp; &ldquo;Before
massa came, many very bad; now, good, and love great
Massa,&rdquo; and so on.&nbsp; Oh, my dear friend, amidst all the
discouraging feelings arising from your not being able to do all
you would, you should not forget what has already been
done.&nbsp; We are most of us too sanguine in our expectations,
<a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>not
suspecting that what exceeds the cool and sober calculation of
tried and well-disciplined faith has too much to do with self,
arises from self-confidence, and ends in self-humiliation.&nbsp;
We are too apt, in imagination, to seize the magic wand of
Harlequin, and suppose that every touch will effect wonders; but,
to change the wilderness into the garden of the Lord, requires
the enduring spirit of the toilsome labourer, the stones must be
cleared, and the soil must again and again be turned: and even
when the precious seed is safely deposited, the patience of our
hope must succeed to the labour of our love.&nbsp; How long does
it usually lie beneath the surface, and when the tender blade
appears, how much longer the interval before the perfection of
the fruit! so long, that my endeared friend may never live to see
it in his own case: though he may sow, yet others may enter into
his labours; yet will both he that sows and they that reap,
rejoice together in that glorious and eternal harvest.</p>
<p>Since I began my letter, I have had a visit from our mutual
friend, Mr. Cox.&nbsp; Since his residence in Shropshire, I have
frequently had opportunities of seeing him, and it is with
unfeigned pleasure that I have seen him evidently advancing in
the best of things.&nbsp; I think, however, that I never saw him
to so great advantage as now&mdash;the truly Christian minister
and the warm and steady friend.&nbsp; He still continues at
Bridgenorth, and has apparently lived through all the hostility
and prejudice which his preaching and residence among them once
excited.&nbsp; He begins also to see some important fruits of his
labours.&nbsp; How cheering is all this!&nbsp; Well, my dear
friend, let us catch the animating glow, and strive to live more
for our loving Saviour and the great glory of his name.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p><i>Kind faithfulness</i> towards our friends is a truly
Christian grace&mdash;this grace the subject of this <a
name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>memoir
eminently possessed, of which the following letter is a
proof:&mdash;</p>
<h3>TO THE SAME.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Madeley, April 28, 1821.</p>
<p>My much endeared Friend,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Though</span> circumstances certainly
appear against me, and give you just reason to suspect that no
very overwhelming tide of affection flows towards my expatriated
brother and fellow-labourer; though I seem to have lost all the
ardent, or the softer feelings of the friend, in the cold and
apathetical conclusions of the mere calculator; though like the
callous brethren of the afflicted Joseph, I seem unconscious of
your grief, and can, like them, selfishly sit down to eat and to
drink, or rise up to consult with others, to decide your fate,
and fix you in sorrow;&mdash;though, I say, all these things
appear against me, and though my friend is constrained to number
me among the annoying trio, yet still I feel within me a pleasing
conviction of real genuine affection, which enables me to rise
above appearances, and which persuades me that I am not quite a
stranger to that love which many waters cannot quench, and which
the floods cannot drown.&nbsp; The fact is, my dear friend, that
the decision to which you allude in your last was my painful and
not my pleasant duty.&nbsp; I felt, I hope, something like the
surgeon who has been called to perform some operation on the most
beloved of his friends; were he to hesitate, or were he to
decline, how justly would he be answerable for all the painful
consequences which might result: but while he proceeds, though
steady to his point, though the fixedness of his eye seems to
proclaim him devoid of pity, though his unshaking hand seems to
indicate <a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
114</span>no shrinking from his work of torture; yet still the
tenderest emotions may exist within, and to the discriminating
eye may be seen in a thousand varying turns.&nbsp; I do not,
indeed, wish you to give me credit for a perfect similarity to
all this, and yet I do hope that when time has a little more
sobered down the strength, and perhaps intensity, of feeling, you
will feel more disposed to thank me for the thankless duty which
my friendship for you enabled me to perform.</p>
<p>My sister and brother Holland are with me at present and have
been here for some weeks past.&nbsp; Many, indeed, are the
pleasures of endeared and social intercourse, and I feel truly
thankful that we have been permitted to enjoy them.&nbsp; We have
never met as a family since my sister was married, and, though
there has been all along an interchange of thought and feeling
through letters, yet we have found how far short all this comes
of viv&acirc; voce and personal communications and
endearments.&nbsp; I have no doubt but that a similar result
would be experienced, could you and I occasionally meet
together.&nbsp; And when we consider the almost insuperable
impediments which lie in the way of such a meeting, some feeling,
perhaps, steals into the mind which would have us think somewhat
hardly of the divine appointments.&nbsp; Let us, however, be
thankful that, though we have not all the sweets of friendship,
yet that so many are still reserved to us.&nbsp; And who can tell
but that these may be increased, if we are only more faithful in
bringing each other, with our mutually known concerns, to our
compassionate God and Saviour?</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>After speaking of the arduous duties of his parish, as
oppressive to the flesh, the mind, and the spirits, he adds, in
his usual heavenly strain, to the same friend:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It is still very blessed to be engaged in
any way for the blessed Saviour.&nbsp; This is, indeed, a <a
name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>work which
pays in the doing.&nbsp; I pray God I may love it even more and
more.&nbsp; But, were it otherwise, were every step toilsome and
thorny, were there no brook to drink of by the way to enable us
to lift up our heads, were the yoke galling and the burden heavy,
were the cross, instead of concealing a latent good, only
cruciating, were the cup of sorrows divested of all sweets and
only filled with strongest bitters; still we have enough of
stimulus arising from the glorious prospect of that blessedness
above to inspirit our souls, and to enable us to toil up the most
arduous ascent, and not only to drag on our wearied feet, but to
lift them up with all the alacrity of cheerful obedience; for the
joy which is set before us, we may well endure the cross, and,
like our blessed Master, despise the shame.&nbsp; O, my dear
Armstrong, may we both of us live more with heaven in our eye,
and with a lively feeling of our Saviour&rsquo;s love in our
hearts!&nbsp; And then every murmur will be hushed, and nothing
be heard from our joyful lips but the language of thanksgiving
and praise.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I hope the children of my late endeared friend will forgive
the following little notice of a father&rsquo;s practice and of
the habits of his children in their juvenile days:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Your letter, received yesterday evening,
speaks somewhat at large on pocket money.&nbsp; I think it
probable, from what you there say, that threepence a week will be
less than you would choose; if so, I will alter, though I think
that threepence altogether unearned is quite sufficient.&nbsp; I
do not give a single penny to my own altogether
gratuitously&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, independent of their own conduct
and exertions; but still, while William was with me, I gave most
liberal inducements to him and them, that they might readily gain
sixpence each weekly, and have sometimes gone as far as a
shilling, and even more.&nbsp; Two of my children have some of
their earnings in the <a name="page116"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 116</span>Savings&rsquo; Bank; one has a
guinea and another has &pound;1 3s.&nbsp; Indeed, my &mdash; boy
is always scheming so largely that he has only a few shillings in
hand, and these are devoted towards making a present of the new
Life of Mr. Fletcher to a poor lad, who, a few weeks since, had
behaved generously to him.&nbsp; But this his excess of
generosity arises, I think, more from his ability to acquire,
than anything else.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;I
will soon earn it;&rdquo; and in earnest he begins, and soon
does.&nbsp; But then, he is always poor, and unless I can snare
him into something like saving habits, I fear he will always be
so.&nbsp; &mdash;, who has a guinea in the bank, is as generous
as &mdash;, nay, has the greater appearance of generosity; for he
has always something by him, and brings it out whenever anything
benevolent is proposed; while &mdash;, being always behind hand,
has to gain his before he can give it.&nbsp; But all my children
have habits of giving; some are careful, but none are penurious,
and I hope never will become so.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>TO THE REV. JOHN ARMSTRONG.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Madeley, June 1, 1822.</p>
<p>My dear Friend,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> afforded me great pleasure to
see, on Tuesday last, your kind friend, Colonel Arthur [now Sir
George Arthur, Bart. and Governor of Bombay], who arrived at
Liverpool on the preceding Friday.&nbsp; He was accompanied by
his lady, three children, and two servants, all of them in good
health, though Mrs. Arthur and the children bore the usual
paleness which Europeans so readily discover in the countenances
of West Indian residents.&nbsp; I felt much gratified by the
colonel&rsquo;s urbanity of manners, and had great pleasure in
showing him and his <a name="page117"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 117</span>lady all the lions of the
place.&nbsp; He seemed greatly to like our neat church and rural
quiet churchyard, and the very ground appeared in his view to be
more than ordinarily consecrated by the residence of the
venerable Fletcher.&nbsp; He gave me much interesting detail
respecting Honduras, its church, its schools, its people, and its
minister; and of the last, he forgot not to mention his
difficulties, his battles, and his eventual successes.&nbsp; He
spoke also of his health, and described him (though perhaps he
would not in this respect receive any great superabundance of
thanks for his pains), as being peculiarly suited to bear all the
labours of his arduous post, and that a change of place, however
it might recreate the spirit, was by no means necessary for the
continuance of his health.&nbsp; Now, I need scarcely tell you
that all this was very refreshing to my spirit.&nbsp; I am not
permitted to see you, and yet such have been the singular
circumstances which have brought me in contact with those who
have long lived in the Bay of Honduras, that I have been favoured
with details almost as lively and circumstantial as an actual
visit could have afforded me.&nbsp; And all the accounts
strengthen in me the conviction that my endeared friend is in his
own real, identical, proper post&mdash;the one by Heaven&rsquo;s
signature stamped with appointment and approbation too.&nbsp; May
the Saviour who has appointed and approved, still bind him to it
by his constraining love!</p>
<p>The colonel was very kind in his inquiries respecting William;
I sent to Mr. Thurgar for him, and the counsels he gave him were
very affectionate and appropriate.&nbsp; He left with him a
sovereign when he parted from us.&nbsp; He seemed particularly
anxious for his welfare, and was very desirous of gleaning
everything encouraging that he might have the satisfaction of
communicating it to you&mdash;a satisfaction evidently very
strong.</p>
<p><a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>Last
night, I received a letter from that very excellent and very
pious man, Mr. Francis Hall, who resided some months in my
parish, as the companion of the New Zealanders, and who went with
them to New Zealand.&nbsp; His whole conduct, while among us,
left an indelible impression of the genuine piety which so humbly
but gracefully dwelt within him.&nbsp; Every recollection of the
dear good man is refreshing to my spirit.&nbsp; But I wander from
my point.&nbsp; I received from him, yesterday, a letter which
ought to make us all truly thankful that we have been
providentially kept here, instead of being suffered to go, as we
had once intended, along with himself or others to this
inhospitable shore.&nbsp; He begins with congratulating us on
this point, and illustrates his congratulation with such a
narration of discouragement, connected with the state of the
mission, as would convince every unprejudiced mind that a family
such as mine has no business there.&nbsp; A time possibly may
come when the signs may become more favourable; but certainly
they are most discouraging now.</p>
<p>I hope I am thankful to God, as the only source of our good,
for the state of things in my own parish.&nbsp; To say there was
an outpouring of the Spirit upon us, would be using language by
far too strong, and yet some gracious drops have
descended&mdash;the dew has been resting upon us.&nbsp; Our
classes increase&mdash;the public means are better attended; our
Sunday schools are more than doubled, and a spirit of hearing
generally prevails.&nbsp; And I feel the more grateful for all
this, as I have all along expected that a seven years&rsquo;
residence among them would produce a listlessness and
indifference bordering on satiety; but, though this term is now
attained within a few days, yet there seems no want of attention
and no diminution in interest.&nbsp; The hearts of the dear
people are still given to me, and, as such, they still bear with
and love me.&nbsp; And if old things are said in their <a

they appear to come home to them with a new power, and that power
I would gratefully acknowledge is from above: to the grace,
therefore, of my Redeemer, I would ascribe the praise.&nbsp; And
I do still cherish a hope that, so long as he shall be pleased to
continue me here, he will graciously command that the barrel of
meal shall not waste, nor the cruse of oil fail; that neither
matter nor unction shall be wanting in my humble
ministrations.&nbsp; Humble they, indeed, are and always will be:
the little treasure which I bear, is in an earthen, a cracked
earthen vessel.&nbsp; But I hope I am still content, so long as
the excellency of the power may be seen of God and not of
man.&nbsp; Here, my dear friend, is the grand point&mdash;we
nothing; Christ all.&nbsp; Oh, blessed feeling!&nbsp; Never are
we so truly happy as when we most fully realize it.</p>
<p>We all unite in kind love to yourself and Mrs. A., and I
remain,</p>
<p style="text-align: center">My dear Friend,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Yours ever sincerely,<br />

<p>The friend to whom the following extract of a letter to the
editor refers, was one whom Mr. Mortimer had strongly urged to
turn his attention towards the service of the sanctuary.&nbsp;
The extract exhibits so beautiful a picture of a good man that I
cannot prevail upon myself to omit it, and yet, not to offend the
retiring feelings of the excellent individual alluded to&mdash;he
being yet alive&mdash;I suppress his name, though to himself and
some few of his friends the name will not be unknown.&nbsp; I
hope he will forgive me this wrong which I have committed for the
sake of others.&nbsp; In a note which the editor received from
this gentleman, forwarding to him several of the letters which he
had received from Mr. Mortimer, he says,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;In honour preferring one
another,&rsquo; seemed to be one of his (Mr. M.&rsquo;s) constant
rules of <a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
120</span>action.&nbsp; For myself, I may most unaffectedly say,
that while I feel grateful to God for the affection of such a
friend for so many years, I equally feel my own utter
unworthiness of such a privilege and blessing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two evenings ago, I received a letter from my excellent
friend, &mdash;, late of &mdash;.&nbsp; He has at length applied
for orders, and was admitted deacon, two Sundays since, by the
venerable Bishop of Norwich.&nbsp; Mr. Horne of Christ Church,
Newgate-street, whose work on the Scriptures you have no doubt
seen reviewed, was admitted by the Bishop of London three years
since, and these two together with myself were a trio of friends
meeting in Mr. Butterworth&rsquo;s class.&nbsp; Orders were at
one time the furthest from all our thoughts, and yet have we been
gradually led forward, and the third has at length joined us in
the blessed and honourable employ.&nbsp; I much regret that he
did not break through his snares and impediments when, about
seven years ago, I strongly urged him to the point; for he would
then have not only spent seven more years in the more immediate
work of the sanctuary, but would have saved himself many painful
exercises and many severe losses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;But oh, how I admire the man!&nbsp; If he
shone in prosperity, how much more in adversity!&nbsp; No murmur
ever escapes him.&nbsp; He does, indeed, glorify his God in the
fires.&nbsp; His altered circumstances make no alteration in the
man, unless, indeed, they have induced greater spirituality of
mind, more complete deadness to the world, and more unreserved
surrender of all his affections and powers to the service of his
God.&nbsp; But here I am backward to speak; for he shone so
conspicuously before, that I find it difficult to determine which
is stronger of the two lights, both so strong that few could bear
with them a momentary comparison.&nbsp; Oh, may <i>our</i>
lights, my dear friend, so shine in every alteration of our
circumstances, <a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
121</span>that we also may, like him, bring glory to our
God!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the beginning of the year 1823, it pleased God to deprive
the church of the valuable labours&rsquo; of the Rev. John Eyton,
Vicar of Wellington, to whom Mr. Mortimer was exceedingly
attached.&nbsp; About seven weeks before his removal, he left
home with the intention of wintering at the Isle of Wight, but
the weather becoming very cold he was obliged to remain at
Portsmouth.&nbsp; The children being all at home, he did not wish
Mrs. Eyton to accompany him; but a few days before his death, she
received an intimation that he wished to see her, and though she
set off the very day she received this information, she did not
arrive till some hours after his departure.&nbsp; In reference to
this painful event, Mr. Mortimer, in a letter to his sister,
says,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The death of Mr. Eyton has filled us with a
degree of consternation and surprise which I find it difficult to
express.&nbsp; In what a changing world do we live, and how many
evils does that part of our punishment &ldquo;death&rdquo;
introduce among us.&nbsp; Prayer seems at present our only
refuge, especially with regard to his bereaved people.&nbsp; The
delicate and very difficult duty of preaching the funeral sermon
has been assigned to me: the flesh would dispose me to decline
were I to attend to its dictates; but I dare not listen.&nbsp; I
owe so much to my endeared and highly honoured friend, that I
feel I must proceed.&nbsp; Let me, however, entreat the
assistance of your prayers.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some time during last year Mr. Mortimer was induced to
undertake the editorship of a monthly publication for young
persons.&nbsp; He refers to this engagement in the following
letter:&mdash;</p>
<h3><a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>TO
THE REV. THOMAS MORTIMER.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Madeley, Feb. 13, 1823.</p>
<p>My dear Brother,</p>
<p>I <span class="smcap">am</span> obliged to you for thinking of
me in reference to my monthly engagements.&nbsp; I can hardly
expect that you should enter with any very lively interest into
this matter, though, I can assure you, your kind assistance would
prove a very acceptable service both to myself and my readers;
nor would the time be altogether lost, if the matter were
considered in sole reference to yourself; at least I should so
conclude, from what I have observed with respect to my own mind
and habits, and I very greatly regret that, for so many years, I
suffered my feelings to prevail over my better judgment, and
cause me to neglect the throwing in of my mite into some channel
of usefulness.&nbsp; But I do not blame others, knowing how very
unwillingly I was pressed into the service myself.&nbsp; I do not
expect that my friends should, by any touch of my poor leaden
wand, start into active and willing contributors.&nbsp; Had I
Orpheus-like powers, the trees and stones might follow me; but I
possess none of these magical or touchingly persuasive means, and
therefore, though, as a point of duty, I every now and then turn
an entreating eye, and raise a feeble supplicating voice, both
the priest and the Levite are afraid of messing themselves in my
poor concerns, and prudently pass over to the other side.&nbsp; I
would not, however, ungratefully involve all in this sweeping and
indiscriminate crimination.&nbsp; A Samaritan or two have kindly
pitied me, and for their equally unexpected and unwearied act of
friendship, I feel myself peculiarly indebted.&nbsp; But why all
this enumeration?&nbsp; Should I not honestly confess that it is
not altogether without <a name="page123"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 123</span>reference to yourself?&nbsp; I am
not a stranger to my good brother&rsquo;s Samaritan-like
feelings, and a distant hope is cherished by me, that he will yet
pour in of his truly welcome supplies.</p>
<p>T. L., I should think, would at present pass quite as good an
examination as his brother B., but I would not recommend him to
be over hasty in applying for orders, nor indeed does he feel
thus disposed himself.&nbsp; Young men, I think, sadly err in
this matter; they hasten into the ministry far too soon, and
repent of their haste all through their subsequent years.&nbsp;
But perhaps it is hardly fair to ascribe all the blame to them:
it originates, in great part, with those who bear the expense of
their education, and who are glad of the first opportunity which
presents itself of getting them off.&nbsp; But T. L. supports
himself, and, therefore, the burden and the advantage both fall,
as they ought, upon the same individual, and he so feels the
desirableness of improving the present time, that he prefers
waiting a little longer.&nbsp; Another pupil who is reading with
me, a very nice young man, supports himself in a similar way; and
I do not intend, for the future, to superintend the studies of
any who do not, in some way or other, pursue the same
method.&nbsp; And</p>
<p style="text-align: center">I remain, my dear Brother,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Yours very affectionately,<br />
G. M.</p>
<h3>TO THE REV. THOMAS MORTIMER.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Madeley, Feb. 5, 1824.</p>
<p>My dear Thomas,</p>
<p style="text-align: center">*******</p>
<p>Matters proceed among us pretty much as usual.&nbsp; My people
are kind, our congregations good, classes very fair, and
attendance on the weekly expositions pleasingly <a
name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
124</span>increasing.&nbsp; As to myself, I can say but little;
sometimes I am enabled to live in the spirit of the petition,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Each moment draw from earth away<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My heart, which lowly waits thy call;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and then my peace flows smooth and tranquil as a river; then
all my affections take their proper channel, and are directed to
a holy spiritual end.&nbsp; But, alas! too generally I find my
feelings and conduct better characterized by complaint than
exultation, and have too much reason to say,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Yet hind&rsquo;rances strew all the way;<br
/>
I aim at thee, yet from thee stray.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But I still keep fixing my eye upon the beauteous light, even
when furthest from it, and most ardently do I sigh after its most
blessed repose.&nbsp; Well, perhaps, after all my failures, I may
still become habitually possessed of it; and indeed without it, I
feel that I shall never enjoy anything like true and substantial
rest.&nbsp; A minister without the inward grace, and that also in
a more than usual measure, is of all others a character most to
be pitied&mdash;I mean of all other Christians; for in order to
instruct others, he must of course be more advanced in knowledge,
and consequently will be called to a far stricter account.&nbsp;
Besides, the whole routine of his employments, carrying with them
the exterior of sanctity, are apt to impress, not only others,
but himself also, with fallacious hopes respecting the safety of
his state.&nbsp; The constant repetition also of his duties has a
strong tendency to render the spiritual impression on himself
less and less vivid, till at length the pious feeling, in many
instances, is entirely absent, and he detects himself half
hypocritically acting or performing a part, attempting to raise
emotion in others to which he is <a name="page125"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 125</span>so much a stranger himself.&nbsp;
These, my dear brother, are our snares&mdash;at least they are
mine; but I hope I not only perceive them, but am watching
against them.&nbsp; And my comfort is, that amidst all my
consciousness of weakness, it is still my privilege to rely on an
all-sufficient Saviour.</p>
<p>You kindly speak in your letter of your being able to assist
me in my editorial labours, by furnishing me with accounts
connected with the different societies.&nbsp; I fear, however,
that the work will not proceed beyond the present volume.&nbsp;
Its sale, I am thankful to state, has increased since it was
placed in my hands, and is still increasing; but it will not
cover the attendant expenditure&mdash;at least not so much so, as
to make it worth the publisher&rsquo;s while to continue.&nbsp;
Its discontinuance, however, will prove no great loss to
me.&nbsp; I edit the numbers of the present volume for &pound;2.
10s. a number, and, when my monthly expenses are deducted, I have
only about &pound;1 each remaining.&nbsp; My object, however, is
not gain, but a desire of being in some way useful; and as a work
of the kind seems desirable, I shall feel a little regret that it
should cease.&nbsp; But perhaps, after it stops, some London
bookseller will venture upon something of a similar kind, and, if
so, it will then, in all probability, succeed. * * * * * We all
unite in sincerest love to yourself, Mrs. T. M., and my dear
niece, and</p>

<p style="text-align: right">Your affectionate Brother,<br />
<span class="smcap">George Mortimer</span>.</p>
<h3>TO THE REV. THOMAS MORTIMER.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Madeley, Dec. 1, 1824.</p>
<p>My dear Brother,</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * * * *</p>
<p>I am afraid, from your intimations respecting your being <a
name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>in quest of
a morning service, that Mr. Pratt has failed in substantiating
his claim; if so, I shall be much concerned.&nbsp; Retired from
the emoluments of a former occupation, he will possibly feel this
diminution in point of income; but for such a servant in the
house of our God, I trust that not mere adequacy, but even the
munificence of our merciful Lord, is in abundant reserve.</p>
<p>You inquire concerning my health.&nbsp; It has been far from
well ever since my return from G&mdash;, strong as I seemed while
there; no sooner did I enter upon my parochial duties, than I
began to fail, and in about a fortnight, I was nearly as ill as
ever.&nbsp; This induced me to lay the whole matter before Mr.
Burton, and to request him to relieve my mind with an assurance
that, in case I should be under the necessity of leaving, he
would kindly indulge the parishioners with a suitable person in
my stead.&nbsp; His kindness has removed my difficulties, and
left me at full liberty to leave my work in more efficient
hands.&nbsp; I have had an application for the curacy from a
gentleman who strikes me as being very suitable, and Mr. Burton
has accepted of his services.&nbsp; One difficulty, however, is
in the way.&nbsp; He holds a living in the diocese of Worcester;
but, being peculiarly circumstanced, he expects that the bishop
will permit him to hold it in conjunction with Madeley, and to
divide his time between them, his curate sharing the twofold duty
with him.&nbsp; Should his application to the bishop not succeed,
he has recommended to me another person, who seems equally
eligible with himself; but with this latter person I have had no
communication.</p>
<p>As to myself, I am of course in uncertainty; but I feel
confident, that as I have hitherto been guided by the wisdom and
goodness of my condescending God, so he will still point out to
me the way in which I should go.</p>
<p><a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>You
speak of the mine of paper and print, and, like too many others,
comfort yourself with considering that your work is but a little
one.&nbsp; But good, my brother, beware, beware!&nbsp; Three
services on a Sabbath, occasional weekly ministrations, and
numerous official employments, should almost entirely exclude
every kind of preparation for the press.&nbsp; With kindest love
&amp;c,</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Believe me, my dear Thomas,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Your ever affectionate Brother,<br
/>
<span class="smcap">George</span>.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>In the spring of 1825, Mr. Mortimer visited his London
friends, one of whom writes as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Your dear brother appeared so full of love
and tenderness, and, at the same time, so interested himself in
everything that appeared to interest us, that we could not help
wishing for a much longer enjoyment.&nbsp; I heard him preach but
once: his sermon was truly edifying.&nbsp; I will transcribe a
brief outline of it, as you may find it a word of consolation in
some season of sorrow.&nbsp; Matt. xv. 28, &lsquo;O woman, great
is thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt.&rsquo;&nbsp; The
advantages resulting from strong faith were pointed out in four
important particulars; viz.&mdash;I. It yields to no
discouragement.&nbsp; II. It bears and even overcomes the most
humiliating discoveries.&nbsp; III. It receives the strongest
marks of the Saviour&rsquo;s approbation.&nbsp; IV. It is put
into eventual possession of every needful good.&nbsp; Each of
these points was marked out as strikingly illustrated in this
affecting and interesting narrative.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His brother, the Rev. Thomas Mortimer, has kindly furnished me
with the following communication respecting the same
sermon:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;On Sunday, the 27th March, 1825, my beloved
<a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>brother
preached for me at my lecture at St. Olave&rsquo;s,
Southwark.&nbsp; I shall never forget that sermon.&nbsp; Being
the only church at that time usually open in the Borough for
Sunday evening service, there was generally a large attendance,
and that evening the church was crowded.&nbsp; On entering the
pulpit, my brother&rsquo;s diminutive figure excited attention;
and, in some, produced a smile.&nbsp; When, however, he had
composed himself in the pulpit, his fine countenance, beaming
with intelligence, evidently inspired some with respect, who, at
first, had looked up with indifference, if not with scorn.&nbsp;
His announcement of his text was most solemn and yet most tender;
&lsquo;O woman, great is thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou
wilt.&rsquo;&nbsp; From that moment the silence of death reigned;
and, after a few minutes, every eye seemed fixed upon the
preacher, and every ear listening to his voice.&nbsp; The scoffer
soon discovered that the preacher was no ordinary man: the candid
inquirer felt interested in the subject: the timid and weak
believer took courage: and the mourner drank in the water of
life, with the eagerness of the thirsty soul.&nbsp; Many a time,
during subsequent years, have the tenderest and most grateful
reference been made to that sermon by those who were accustomed
to converse with me on the great concerns of their souls.&nbsp;
Though nearly twenty years have rolled away since that memorable
night, the recollection of my beloved brother, of the touching
words that fell from his lips, and the &lsquo;unction of the Holy
One,&rsquo; which evidently attended them, is still vivid and
delightful, and will, I doubt not, accompany me to my
grave.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Intimation has already been given, in a letter to his brother,
of Mr. Mortimer&rsquo;s entertaining thoughts of leaving Madeley,
owing to the declining state of his health.&nbsp; The following
several letters refer to <a name="page129"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 129</span>that event and to arrangements for
filling up his important post in that parish.</p>
<h3>TO THE REV. JOHN COOPER.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Yardley, near Birmingham, Sept. 12,
1825.</p>
<p>My dear Friend,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Your</span> very kind and acceptable
letter reached me three or four weeks since; and I should have
answered it much earlier had I not been in some uncertainty as to
my proximate movements; and I thought I would wait till something
definite should have transpired.&nbsp; I have been here very
nearly seven months, and was thinking of returning to Madeley in
about a month from the present time; but it is now arranged that
we should continue here till the middle of February.&nbsp; From
what you mention in your letter, I should suppose that you have
been informed that I had left Madeley altogether, but this is not
the case; I have only <i>exchanged</i> duties with the vicar of
this place, who has been, like myself, out of health for some
months past, and who thought that a complete change of sphere and
situation would prove beneficial to him.&nbsp; He and his family,
therefore, reside in the vicarage at Madeley, and myself and
family here; both of us having left our furniture, library,
&amp;c., &amp;c., for each other&rsquo;s accommodation.&nbsp; The
duties in this place being light, as compared with Madeley, and
the air exceedingly salubrious, I have found great benefit from
the change, and am pretty nearly as well as I was before I began
to fail; the whole of my family, also, have found their health
considerably improved; so that in this point of view we have
reason to be thankful for the exchange.&nbsp; And I hope, also,
that the change of ministrations will be beneficial to both our
parishes.&nbsp; I hear of an <a name="page130"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 130</span>increased attention being produced
at Madeley, and I ought to acknowledge with gratitude the
acceptance with which I am favoured here.</p>
<p>You mention in your letter that your engagement in your
present curacy will terminate early in 1827.&nbsp; I read that
part of your letter to Mr. Gwyther (the gentleman with whom I
have exchanged duties), who was over here a few days ago, and he
said, &ldquo;Could we not contrive between us to keep the curacy
open for Mr. C. till he should be able to take it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our present arrangement will, if we are spared, bring us to
the middle of February, 1826, which is only a year short of the
time when you will be released from your present charge.&nbsp;
Now, if we could manage so as to supply till then, would you like
to undertake the charge of the parish, provided the incumbent
would admit you, which, from what I have lately ascertained, I
think could easily be managed?&nbsp; Since I saw you I have
engaged with an assistant, but merely <i>pro tempore</i>; the
expense of which is to be principally borne by the
parishioners.&nbsp; The sum allowed to him will be &pound;100 a
year; towards which I myself give &pound;30, on condition of
being occasionally absent, should my health require it, at the
sea or elsewhere.&nbsp; The value of my curacy is full &pound;100
a year besides the house.&nbsp; You will perceive, then, that
matters are now made much easier for you, should you think of
fixing your lot among the Madeley people, and I am confident that
the arrangement would be highly gratifying to them.</p>
<h3>TO THE REV. JOHN COOPER.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Yardley, February 21, 1826.</p>
<p>My dear Friend,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Though</span> I fully intended to have
answered your very <a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
131</span>kind letter within the time that you specified, yet, as
it bears date October 15, I find that I have exceeded the
proposed interval <i>by more than a month</i>.&nbsp; So much for
my <i>friendship</i>.&nbsp; Had it been a letter <i>on
business</i>, I have little hesitation in saying that it would
have been duly despatched; and, had there been a dozen of this
kind, I think I might venture to assert the same.&nbsp; But my
friends, and those also the most intimate and endeared, are too
generally neglected; and many are the kind reproofs which my
remissness thus draws upon me.&nbsp; You, indeed, my dear friend,
have, <i>in silence</i>, borne with all; and this ought to have
made me more cautious in giving you fresh occasions of
pain.&nbsp; But nothing seems of sufficient influence to correct
the inveteracy of my habit; and, therefore, I must still, I fear,
keep confessing my reiterated faults, and as often keep throwing
myself upon the kind forgiveness and forbearance of my
friends.</p>
<p>I am still, as you will perceive from my date, at Yardley,
and, from a fresh arrangement, our exchange will be prolonged
from March till the latter end of July next.&nbsp; Nothing has as
yet been done about an assistant curate for Madeley.&nbsp; About
a fortnight ago, I was congratulating myself on the acquisition
of a very desirable fellow-helper, the Rev. A. B&mdash;, who had
consented to join with me in the duties of the parish, and had
engaged the residence of our late departed friend Mrs. E&mdash;;
but some obstacles have since arisen, so that I fear we shall now
lose him.&nbsp; Should he decline, I shall not be over anxious in
making any permanent arrangement with any one else until my
return in July, by which time I should hope you will be able to
speak somewhat more definitely as to your own movements, as there
will be only about six months to the time of your own projected
removal.&nbsp; The impediments which have been thrown in the way
of every negotiation which I have entered <a
name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>into for so
many months past, incline me to think that it is more than
possible the situation may, after all, be reserved for my
endeared friend.&nbsp; But of the future how little, or rather,
how completely nothing, are we permitted to know; and if we busy
ourselves in the shrewdest guesses, or the most cool and sober
calculations, how generally are we disappointed!&nbsp; It is our
wisdom, therefore, to be more occupied with the duties which more
immediately devolve upon us at the present, than with
speculations about the <i>probabilities</i> of more remote and
distant periods.</p>
<p>In the foregoing page, I mentioned the name of dear Mrs.
E&mdash;, and I had no sooner done this than the recollection of
all that transpired between us, during your short visit to us at
Madeley, passed vividly through my mind.&nbsp; What a painful
winding up of W&mdash; matters!&nbsp; But yet, in many respects,
how merciful! * * * With respect, however, to the endeared
individual so lately severed from her important charge, I have
nothing to say, but what is encouraging: most clearly, most
satisfactorily, had she been latterly ripening for that blessed
world of spirits.&nbsp; And as to the dear family which she has
left behind, &ldquo;let us not sorrow as those without
hope.&rdquo;&nbsp; They are beloved by many for their
parent&rsquo;s sake, and, in a qualified use of the term, we may,
perhaps, state the same respecting their parent&rsquo;s faithful
and condescending God.&nbsp; For He will, no doubt, remember them
peculiarly for good, and that for their parent&rsquo;s sake; for
the good inheritance of their anxious desires and their holy
fervent prayers, will, sooner or later, be abundantly
possessed.&nbsp; We were truly thankful to hear of dear Mrs.
C&mdash;&rsquo;s gradual amendment in health; and though it may
not be commensurate with our naturally impatient and restless
desires, yet every increase of so invaluable a blessing should
call forth our grateful praise.&nbsp; We beg to unite in very <a
name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>kindest and
Christian regards to her, yourself, and family, and I remain,</p>
<p style="text-align: center">My dear Friend,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Yours very sincerely,<br />
<span class="smcap">George Mortimer</span>.</p>
<h3>TO THE REV. THOMAS MORTIMER.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Yardley, June 20, 1826.</p>
<p>My dear Brother,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">From</span> what you must have perceived
of the evident inclining of my mind while you were here, you will
not be much surprised at the contents of the accompanying
circular.&nbsp; I have long paused, and, I hope, deliberately
weighed, as well as sincerely prayed, and now I must leave the
result in the overruling hands of an all-wise and ever-gracious
God.&nbsp; This I am thankful to state, that I am at present
enabled to do, with a measure of calm and peaceful reliance,
which I did not at all anticipate.</p>
<h3>TO THE INHABITANTS OF MADELEY.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Yardley, June 19, 1826.</p>
<p>My much-endeared Parishioners,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> I left Madeley, in consequence
of the delicate state of my health, I had fully intended to have
rejoined you in a few months.&nbsp; Various circumstances,
however, induced me to accept the proposals made at different
times by Mr. Gwyther, for lengthening the period of our exchange:
and now that this period is nearly terminated, I regret to be
under the necessity of stating, that I feel so strongly my total
inadequacy to resume my wonted station among you, that I dare not
venture upon it.</p>
<p><a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>My
health has indeed, through the blessing of God, upon the
diminution of my parochial duties, been considerably
amended.&nbsp; It is the opinion, however, of all my more
intimate friends, that, should I return to my charge, I shall in
a few weeks sink under the pressure of those numerous parochial
cares and duties which before so materially injured me.&nbsp; I
have, therefore, felt constrained to resign my situation; and
have just written to Mr. Burton, stating to him, that I shall
vacate the Curacy at Michaelmas next.</p>
<p>I have not mentioned to him anything respecting my successor,
leaving a matter so materially affecting yourselves to your own
superior judgment.&nbsp; I hope, however, that the principal
inhabitants of the parish will lose no time in making a proper
application to him; and from the repeated proofs which I have had
of his kind feeling towards you, I have no doubt but that he will
comply with any request which they may see fit to make to
him.</p>
<p>As to my own future movements I am altogether ignorant.&nbsp;
I trust, however, that the same gracious <span
class="smcap">God</span>, who guided my steps among you, will
still appoint for me my future path: and with regard to
yourselves, a people who will never cease to be remembered by me
with feelings of the strongest affection, I do most sincerely
pray that a pastor may be given to you who shall, in all
respects, answer your most sanguine wishes: and thus supply my
own numerous and often-lamented deficiencies.</p>
<p>Believe me to remain,</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Your very affectionate though
unworthy Minister,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">George

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The above was also sent to his friend, the Rev. John Cooper,
accompanied by the following letter:&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><a name="page135"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 135</span>Yardley, June 26, 1826.</p>
<p>My dear Friend,</p>
<p>I <span class="smcap">feel</span> that I ought not any longer
to keep you in ignorance of my recent decision respecting
Madeley, though from what my brother has told me as to inquiries
made for you in London, I have no expectation of the situation
being really desirable to you.&nbsp; Nor, indeed, if it were so,
would the time of your leaving your present charge admit of your
accepting it; for some one will, no doubt, be immediately
engaged, and to whom I would surrender as soon as might be
required.&nbsp; Our own movements, as I have expressed in the
accompanying circular, are quite uncertain; my wife, however,
seems strongly to incline towards the neighbourhood of Clifton,
in which spot she wishes to be permanently established.&nbsp; It
is probable, therefore, that we shall bend our steps thither, and
when somewhat established I will try to obtain some light
permanent duty in the neighbourhood.&nbsp; &ldquo;Que Dieu nous
dirige,&rdquo; is the frequent aspiration of my too solicitous
mind&mdash;<i>too</i> solicitous; for if I knew all the gracious
intentions of a God of love concerning us, I should peacefully
leave everything to his all-wise disposal, without the least
degree of restlessness or fear.</p>
<p>With respect to dear Madeley, I need scarcely add, that should
you know any one who strikes you as being suitable, and to whom
the situation would be agreeable, I should feel obliged by your
mentioning it to him, and getting him to communicate with Mr.
G&mdash; on the subject.</p>
<p>We beg our very kindest and Christian regards to yourself and
Mrs. C, and, with much affection,</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Believe me, my dear Friend,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Yours very sincerely,<br />
G. M.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p><a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>After
receiving the above with its enclosed circular, Mr. Cooper wrote
to his friend as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Wherwell, June 29, 1826.</p>
<p>My dear Friend,</p>
<p>I <span class="smcap">was</span> not prepared for the
intelligence contained in your very kind letter of the 26th,
having hoped, from the improvement of your health at the date of
your previous letter, that you would shortly return to your
important charge at Madeley, and that you might have continued
there many years, an instrument of blessing others, and being
<i>increasingly</i> blessed yourself in your work.&nbsp; But, I
doubt not, all is well and wisely ordered, and will add my
affectionate though feeble prayers that you may be divinely
directed in all things.</p>
<p>Your letter, the end of February last, left it doubtful,
whether Mr. A. B&mdash; might not have finally determined to
become your assistant in the parish; and, prior to your last
favour, I was looking to hear from you next month, to know how
this matter had terminated, in order that I might judge whether
the expectation of being associated with you, which I had not
entirely relinquished, might not be realized.&nbsp; I now beg to
state, that, owing to the inquiries of a beloved clerical
brother, two curacies have been offered to me within the present
month, both of which I have declined.&nbsp; And now, my dear
friend, I put it to you, whether you think Madeley is such a post
as would suit one with such slender ministerial qualifications as
I deeply feel that I possess; and whether you think your
parishioners would be disposed to receive me favourably?&nbsp; If
you do, I leave myself in God&rsquo;s hand and yours, desiring
that <i>He</i> may do with me as seemeth good in His sight; and
requesting <i>you</i> to take such steps as you may judge
proper.&nbsp; The difficulty <a name="page137"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 137</span>as to the time of resigning my
present cure may probably be got over soon after Michaelmas; my
vicar having said, when last I saw him, that he would release me
on reasonable notice, if anything eligible should be offered to
me: still I wish to remain in my present sphere as long as I
conveniently can.&nbsp; Having said thus much, I will only add
that Madeley has been regarded by me for many years as a spot
peculiarly sacred; it is still more endeared to me by the
consideration that my beloved and highly esteemed friend has been
labouring for ten years in that favoured scene of the apostolical
Fletcher&rsquo;s ministry.</p>
<p>I wait with interest, but not with any anxiety, to hear from
you the result of my present communication.&nbsp; Believe me
ever,</p>
<p style="text-align: center">My dear Friend,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Yours very affectionately,<br />
<span class="smcap">John Cooper</span>.</p>
<h3>TO THE REV. THOMAS MORTIMER.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Yardley, July 11, 1826.</p>
<p>My dear Brother,</p>
<p>You will be glad to hear that dear Cooper has expressed a wish
to succeed me at Madeley; and, in consequence, an application has
been made by myself and the parishioners on his behalf, which has
been most favourably received, and Mr. Burton has nominated him
to succeed me.&nbsp; Most truly thankful do I feel that it has
pleased God to give to the dear people such a man.&nbsp; May he
long be continued to them, and may very blessed days be still in
reserve for that honoured spot.</p>
<p>My visit among them was highly gratifying to myself, and I
hope I may say not unacceptable to them.&nbsp; I never witnessed
in them such overflowings <a name="page138"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 138</span>of kindest feelings, and, what I
hardly anticipated, while they manifested affectionate regrets, I
do not recollect a single instance in which they censured or
chode; but, on the contrary, seemed to think that the step,
though painful, was necessary.</p>
<p>Our own plans are still somewhat uncertain.&nbsp; We think,
however, of moving towards Bristol, and of fixing somewhere
within a mile or two of the city, and have written to George Yate
to engage us a ready-furnished house for about a month.&nbsp; We
expect to leave this place the 30th of August.</p>
<p>But I have said nothing of dear Mr. Butterworth&rsquo;s
removal, on which your last letter principally dwelt.&nbsp; I
felt surprised and pained beyond my ordinary feelings on such
occasions; for almost all that I possess spiritually, I owe,
under God, to him.&nbsp; But after all, he is not lost to me, for
I trust I shall rejoin him ere long; and, even during the short
interval of apparent separation, who can tell how near he may
still be to me, and how materially he may still be permitted to
help me?&nbsp; But, however this may be, Jesus remains the same,
and I trust that the removal of every endeared medium of good may
be the means of uniting me more fully to Him.</p>
<p>Our kindest love to yourself and family, to my dear mother,
Eliza, &amp;c.; and I remain,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Your ever affectionate Brother,<br
/>
<span class="smcap">George</span>.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The <i>letter</i> from which the following extract is made, is
chiefly in reference to the providing means for an
assistant-curate at Madeley; towards which, Mr. Mortimer proposed
to furnish &pound;10 per annum, and also a further sum of
&pound;10 per annum to aid the Curate&rsquo;s Poor Fund, for
relieving the sick and distressed poor of the populous parish of
Madeley; and it is due to Mr. M.&rsquo;s kindness and benevolence
to <a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
139</span>state, that during the period of his friend&rsquo;s
curacy, he generously contributed each year the proposed amount
for the poor; and for three years (during which time only an
assistant curate was employed), the like sum towards the other
object named.</p>

<p style="text-align: right">Yardley, July 31, 1826.</p>
<p>My dear Friend,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Our</span> way towards Bristol appears to
be opening.&nbsp; A very singular circumstance connected with it
has just occurred.&nbsp; It seems to us all to be too
pantomimic&mdash;too magical&mdash;to be true.&nbsp; But yet,
what cannot the God of wisdom and of love effect!&nbsp; We are
striving to wait, as you expressed yourself in a former letter
about Madeley, &ldquo;with interest but without anxiety&rdquo; to
see the result.&nbsp; Oh, what a comfort it is to feel calmly
assured that, while we are leaving ourselves in God&rsquo;s
hands, all must eventually be well.&nbsp; Mary unites with me in
kindest regards to yourself and dear Mrs. C&mdash;, and</p>

<h3>TO THE SAME.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Horfield, near Bristol, October 18,
1826.</p>
<p>My very dear Friend,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Had</span> not circumstances of various
kinds interfered, you would ere this have seen me at Wherwell;
but, as I had no control over these, and kept expecting that in a
few more days I should be able to write to <a

definitely, I hope you will not too harshly censure me, when I
tell you at length that my projected visit, like too many of my
projections, has come to nothing, and that it will not be in my
power to see you before you leave.&nbsp; But, after all, your
removal is not to a distant country, and many may be the
circumstances which the kind Providence of God shall permit for
our future intercourse.&nbsp; You speak, indeed, of a kind of
necessity for conference and consultation at the present
juncture.&nbsp; Of this, however, I am far from being convinced;
for I think a stranger always proceeds best with the least
previous acquaintance with the minuti&aelig; of characters and
proceedings.&nbsp; A general idea is quite necessary; but
everything that is circumstantial creates a prejudice either to
the advantage or disadvantage of the parties concerned.&nbsp; The
fresh unbiassed inspection brings us, for the most part, nearest
the truth.&nbsp; Every one with whom I converse, who has any
knowledge of you, joins with me in thankfulness to God that it
has pleased Him to direct your steps to Madeley; most fully does
it seem to have been, from beginning to end, from Him; to Him,
therefore, may we ever give the praise.&nbsp; And may you, my
much-endeared friend, be so fully qualified for your important
charge; may the barrel of meal also granted for your dear
people&rsquo;s supply waste not, nor the cruse of oil fail; or,
in other words, may matter and unction be so abundantly imparted,
and so graciously continued, that the time may never come in
which your ministrations may prove burdensome to yourself, or
either uninteresting or unedifying to your hearers.&nbsp; With
kindest regards, I remain,</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Mr. Mortimer&rsquo;s life has now been brought down to the
close of his services at Madeley, where he had <a
name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>been
resident pastor for about ten years.&nbsp; In taking a review of
this period, we find him to have abounded in the great duties of
his office&mdash;in works of faith and labours of love.&nbsp;
What with his Sunday duties, his classes, his expositions, his
schools, his pastoral visits, and his manifold acts of charity
and kindness to the poor, in a parish containing very nearly six
thousand souls, with his weakly constitution, and by no means
robust health, the wonder is that he was enabled to carry on so
arduous a course for so long a time.&nbsp; Madeley has been long
and highly favoured; it is to be hoped that the people have both
appreciated and improved their privileges.&nbsp; Mr. Mortimer met
with much kindness, encouragement, and acceptance in the diligent
pursuit of his self-denying career in that parish, and the decade
of his services there was no doubt attended with much usefulness,
though the extent of it may never be known until the great day
shall reveal it.&nbsp; He met also with much that was trying and
perplexing to him; much to wound his loving spirit; much to
grieve his affectionate heart; much to prove his faith and try
his patience; but he neither flinched from duty, nor swerved from
the line of conduct which became him as a minister of the
Established Church; and, what is more, he treated neither
opposition in the spirit of retaliation, nor opposers in a spirit
of harshness or severity.&nbsp; He was eminently a man of peace,
a man of love, a man of placability.&nbsp; The commencement of
his services in the parish was attended with great
difficulties.&nbsp; Considerable irregularities had been
practised by his predecessors; in their steps, in this respect,
he was determined not to tread; and though he felt himself bound
to resist all entreaty on this subject, to the offending of many,
yet was it his prayer, his study, his endeavour to conciliate
all.&nbsp; His steady though moderate Churchmanship was, perhaps,
always more or less a ground of offence in a parish which had
long been under the influence of Methodism; <a
name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>but
wherever good sense and piety prevailed his motives were
respected, and his conduct appreciated.</p>
<p>It was on the manifestation of some unhallowed zeal of party
spirit that the following addresses were printed and circulated
in his parish, and which exhibit the very moderate and
conciliatory spirit of their truly Christian author.</p>
<h3>ADDRESS OF THE MINISTER OF MADELEY TO SUCH OF THE INHABITANTS
OF COALBROOKDALE AND ITS VICINITY, AS DO NOT CONSIDER THEMSELVES
MEMBERS OF THE ESTABLISHED CHURCH.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Vicarage, February 21, 1822.</p>
<p>My endeared Parishioners,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> has lately appeared to me an
indispensable duty to visit more extensively my parish, and to
devote myself more fully to other branches of my ministerial
office.&nbsp; In the course of my visits I found a strong regret
expressed by many, that it was not in their power to connect
themselves either with me as their minister, or with the
Established Church as their religious communion: and that this,
their inability, arose principally from the great distance of the
parish church from their respective abodes.&nbsp; This difficulty
I have endeavoured partially to remove by beginning an exposition
on alternate Monday evenings: <a name="citation142"></a><a
href="#footnote142" class="citation">[142]</a> and I hope soon to
be able still further <a name="page143"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 143</span>to meet their wishes by assembling
with them every other Sunday morning, on a plan similar to that
now adopted at the Ironbridge school-room on the Sabbath
evenings.</p>
<p>I feel a little apprehensive, however, lest these my
proceedings should be considered by some as intentionally
interfering with other modes and places of worship already
adopted and attended in your neighbourhood; and lest my motives
should be so far misconstrued, as to be identified with
narrow-minded prejudice, or with intolerant hostility.</p>
<p>It should be remembered, however, that all persons have, and
cannot help having, their preferences; and likewise, that these
preferences may be openly shown by them, and even occasionally
employed in influencing others, without the least hostility
towards those who continue in another persuasion.&nbsp; And I can
appeal with the greatest confidence to my own conduct during
nearly seven years&rsquo; residence among you, as a proof of this
assertion.&nbsp; For though I have uniformly shown a decided
preference towards the Established Church, yet I am not aware of
having discovered, in a single instance, the least opposition or
hostility towards any individual of another communion, merely as
such.&nbsp; Much, indeed, on my first coming into the parish, was
unhappily advanced to the contrary; but I was determined to take
no notice of such remarks, assured that they had no foundation in
myself, and that, when my line of conduct should be better
understood, they would gradually die away, and a different
feeling be eventually adopted.&nbsp; This different feeling has,
I am happy to state, long been cherished by many; and it was from
a strong desire that nothing contrary to it should prevail in
consequence of my present ministerial procedures, that I have
been induced to send you this circular address.</p>
<p>Oh, let me then, as your minister, entreat you not to <a
name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>regard me
with a misgiving or suspecting mind; but from the fulness of a
loving and a Christian heart to wish and to supplicate for me
abundant success.&nbsp; And be not hasty in censuring either
myself or others for attachment to our venerable and established
forms.&nbsp; Give to us what you feel entitled to demand for
yourselves; I mean the right of preference.&nbsp; And amidst
certain shades of difference, let brotherly love not only
continue among us, but let it abound yet more and more.&nbsp; And
with regard to myself, I do most sincerely pray God that no
feeling may be cherished by me, no single expression uttered, and
no conduct whatever pursued, which may, in any respect, tend to
its diminution.</p>
<p>With feelings, then, of unfeigned affection, believe me, my
much-endeared Parishioners,</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Your sincerely devoted Friend and
Minister,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">George
Mortimer</span>.</p>
<h3>ADDRESS OF THE MINISTER OF MADELEY TO THE INHABITANTS OF
MADELEY WOOD AND ITS VICINITY.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Vicarage, March 23, 1822.</p>
<p>My endeared Parishioners,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> very kind reception given to
the Address which I circulated among the inhabitants of
Coalbrookdale and its vicinity, and the feelings of mutual love
and affection it has been the means of eliciting, encourage me to
hope that a similar appeal to yourselves will be attended with
equally beneficial results.</p>
<p>The principal reason of my now addressing you, is, that I have
very painfully witnessed, within the short space of two or three
weeks, a great increase of party spirit arising from the measures
recently adopted towards forming and carrying on a Sunday school
separate and distinct from that which has so <a
name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>long been
established among us.&nbsp; The natural consequences of such
procedures, I am willing to hope, you did not sufficiently
estimate, or I can hardly imagine you would so hastily, and at
such a time, have adopted them.&nbsp; You are sensible, I think,
that my wish is for peace; that my great desire is, that love may
not only prevail, but abound more and more; and that I am
striving to pursue that line of conduct, which, as a consistent
minister of the Established Church, devolves upon me, so as not
to give the least unnecessary offence to others.&nbsp; Permit me,
then, to ask, whether these recent measures are at all likely to
produce such pacific results?&nbsp; Do they not rather tend to
range more decidedly than ever under distinct and separate
parties, not only the superintendents and teachers, but likewise
the parents of the children themselves?&nbsp; Do they not in some
measure force persons to declare themselves on one side or other,
and that not merely in opinion, but likewise in decisive
action?&nbsp; And are not the individuals, thus compelled to
declare themselves, regarded with suspicion by those who move in
contrary directions?&nbsp; I would inquire, then, is all this
calculated to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of
peace?&nbsp; And are those individuals our best friends who are
most earnest in this work of alienation?&nbsp; I mean no personal
allusions, I assure you, to any individual among you: I hope I
very sincerely love you all; and I wish that bonds of union may
be multiplied, which may bring us closer and closer together,
instead of these cords of separation which, drawing in other
directions, will every day remove us to a greater and yet greater
distance.</p>
<p>Permit me also to ask whether this is the time for such
exertions?&nbsp; If indeed your minister were sleeping at his
post; if he were lying down, and loving to slumber; if the
schools happened to be on the decline in respect of numbers, or
in regard to <a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
146</span>the insufficiency of superintendents or teachers; if
scarcely anything were going forward adequate to the necessities
of the parish; then, indeed, such exertions might be called
for.&nbsp; But how contrary is all this to the real state of the
case!&nbsp; It is at a time when the schools are so crowded as to
render it impossible to instruct them in the usual place: it is
at a time when, to afford greater facilities of instruction, the
larger schools are being divided into twenty or thirty minor
schools, and these so situated as to be almost at the door of
every child in the parish, and so arranged as to admit of every
one being taught who is capable of instruction.&nbsp; You will
readily perceive, then, that the stir which is making at present,
is by no means called for in the existing necessities of the
case.&nbsp; To what, then, must it be attributed?&nbsp; It is
commonly reported that it arises from a fear entertained by some,
lest my present plans and procedures should attach too many
children to the Established Church, and thus eventually make them
Churchmen instead of Methodists.&nbsp; This reason, however, I
feel I ought by no means to admit; for, whatever may be said of
others, the Methodists of the parish of Madeley have long made it
their boast that they were firm in their attachment to our
venerable Church: and so strong has been their attachment, that
the majority of them would never listen to any proposals of
having their services so conducted as at all to interfere with
the services of the church, and would never permit the sacrament
to be administered in their chapels; and there are many who feel
a secret satisfaction in being able to state, that they have
never yet partaken of the sacred ordinance, excepting from a
clergyman; and they are still determined that no one shall ever
make this their consistent glorying to be in vain. <a
name="citation146"></a><a href="#footnote146"
class="citation">[146]</a>&nbsp; It is <a
name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>with
peculiar satisfaction, that I consider my relation to such
individuals; and I assure you, I rejoice over you as my
parishioners; I point you out as an example to others; and I hope
we shall never see the time when the parishioners, and more
especially the spiritual sons and daughters of the venerable and
apostolic Mr. Fletcher, shall cease to be identified with that
Church of which he was so bright an ornament, as well as
minister.&nbsp; I feel, therefore, that it would be the height of
injustice to suppose, that the mass of such of my people as are
termed Methodists have any fear of their children becoming
members of the Established Church; nay, they would rather rejoice
in it;&mdash;they rejoice in it even now;&mdash;and some of them
go so far as even to recommend it.&nbsp; They tell their
children, in the fulness of their Catholic spirit, that their own
attachment to the people with whom they are joined, never arose
from dissatisfaction to the Church, but from a natural love to
the private means which their own people at that time so
exclusively possessed.&nbsp; But they add, that as these same
private means are now offered to them in connexion with the
Established Church, they would advise them to join themselves
with its respected members; and hence it is, that not a few <a
name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>among our
classes are the sons and daughters of such honoured
individuals.&nbsp; I say honoured, for who can withhold from such
the proper meed of approbation; for such heal the breaches of our
Zion, they build up its waste places; they repair the desolations
of many generations.</p>
<p>I am aware, however, that the same extent of feeling is not
cherished by all.&nbsp; Some prefer their own communion, their
own instructors, and classes.&nbsp; But I have heard such with
the greatest candour acknowledge, that their predilection arose
merely from the circumstance that they happened to receive their
first religious good among them; and that notwithstanding this
their preference, they very highly respect the Church, and that
they wish its ministers abundant success in their very important
work.&nbsp; And this I am persuaded is the feeling of ninety-nine
out of a hundred of the Methodists who compose my parish.&nbsp;
The welcome they invariably give me when I enter their houses or
cottages; the smile of approbation which brightens on their
countenance when we exchange salutations as we pass; and the
liberality which they discover in all points of possible
difference whenever they are accidentally touched upon: all these
things convince me that they have no hostility either to the
Church or to myself, and of course that they would not willingly
enter upon any plan which might have the least semblance of
opposition.</p>
<p>To what, then, some will still ask, must these procedures
connected with the schools be attributed?&nbsp; I feel, I
confess, somewhat at a loss to determine.&nbsp; I hope, however,
that they have arisen merely from a well-meant, though certainly
an ill-timed, zeal&mdash;a zeal, likewise, which has a direct
tendency, though not previously estimated, to promote disunion
among us, and a diminution of loving Christian feelings.&nbsp;
But whatever may have been the cause of these <a
name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 149</span>procedures,
I do hope, that the serious evils which are beginning as a
consequence to break forth, will not only be checked, but
entirely subside; and that all parties, superintendents,
teachers, and parents, will each in their respective stations be
ready to show that they are not among the last to bring about so
desirable an issue.</p>
<p>And now, with very sincere affection, believe me, my
much-endeared Parishioners,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Your faithful Friend and
Minister,<br />
<span class="smcap">George Mortimer</span>.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The following simple narrative, related by his attached and
faithful servant Fanny, also beautifully displays the very kind
and earnest, though very decided, character of the excellent
pastor of Madeley.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Some of the beer shops at the Iron Bridge
used to be kept open very late at night, and master was
determined to put a stop to their being open later than ten
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; He used to go to them, and turn out all the
men that were drinking in them after that time.&nbsp; This
enraged some of these men so much, that they declared they would
kill master; for they said, &lsquo;they were determined that no
parson should interfere with them.&rsquo;&nbsp; Some of
master&rsquo;s friends heard of this, and told him, and tried to
persuade him not to go to the Iron Bridge the next night; and Mr.
and Mrs. Thomas did not wish him to go; and we all begged him to
stay at home that night; but he told us he was not at all afraid
of the men, and when I said that they would be sure to do him
some harm, he said, &lsquo;Why, Fanny, they have no power over me
to hurt me; the Almighty is above them.&rsquo;&nbsp; So master
went to the public house, and saw the very men that had
threatened to kill him, and he talked to them for a long time,
and told them that they ought to have been at home with their
families, and that he <a name="page150"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 150</span>hoped he should never see them there
again.&nbsp; He spoke so kindly, that they all listened to him,
and never offered to hurt him; and when he had done talking to
them, they told him, that they had fully determined to make an
attack upon him that night, but that <i>then</i> they felt as if
they had no power to hurt him.&nbsp; So master shook hands with
them all, and then they all took off their hats and wished him
&lsquo;safe home,&rsquo; and &lsquo;long life to
him.&rsquo;&nbsp; And they were never there again after ten
o&rsquo;clock; and I think what master said to them then, did one
or two of them so much good, that they afterwards became
pious.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Mortimer was equally desirous of putting a stop to the
desecration of the Lord&rsquo;s day by the bargemen on the River
Severn, and, for this purpose, he tried every means to prevent
the barges from sailing on the Sunday.&nbsp; In doing this, he
experienced great opposition from some of the barge owners, who
purposely, as it appeared, kept their vessels locked at Coalport
at the latter end of the week, and released them on the
Sunday.&nbsp; At length Mr. M. was compelled to take them before
the magistrates, and have them fined, by which means he succeeded
in entirely putting a stop to this desecration.</p>
<p>He exerted himself also to have the law enforced against
keeping open the public houses and beer shops during the time of
divine service.</p>
<p>He took pains to prevent the children from playing about the
roads and fields on the Sunday, and to secure the orderly
behaviour of the Sunday scholars in going to and returning from
the Sunday schools.&nbsp; There were at one period six hundred
children in the different schools in the parish of Madeley.</p>
<p>The class meetings consisted of six; one for women, conducted
by Mrs. Mortimer, and the other five by Mr. M.&nbsp; Once a
quarter, the six classes met at one place.&nbsp; Mr.
Mortimer&rsquo;s object in having these class <a
name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>meetings,
though he evidently considered them as auxiliary to the public
ordinances of religion, was to prevent the serious members of his
congregation from joining the Methodists, which he had constantly
found to be the case at Wellington.</p>
<p>The following token of affectionate esteem was, no doubt, very
acceptable to the feelings of Mr. Mortimer, not so much from the
worth of it, as from the motive which gave rise to it&mdash;a
motive at once honourable to the hearts of the donors and to the
character of the receiver.&nbsp; This token was a handsome octavo
Bible, bound in morocco, inscribed on one side,</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;To the Rev.
George Mortimer, <span class="GutSmall">M.A.</span><br />
A Token of Christian Regard<br />
From the Male Class, meeting under his care at Lincoln-hill,<br
/>
1817.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And on the other side,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;With a sincere desire that the rich
promises contained herein may be his consolation through life,
and his support in death.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following anecdote may, perhaps, be more suitably
introduced here than elsewhere, because, in all probability, it
was during his residence at Madeley that the fact recorded took
place, though it was not related to his daughter, who
communicated it to me, before the winter of 1842&ndash;3, during
a sleigh-drive with her father, while descending a hill, which
was in a dangerous state, owing to its slipperiness and to there
being no barrier on the one side which was the edge of a
precipice.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;K&mdash; and I (and perhaps a third person,
but I am not sure about that) were travelling from Wellington to
Madeley in a post chaise.&nbsp; When we were about to descend a
precipitous hill, something seemed to say to me, &lsquo;Pray, you
are in danger.&rsquo;&nbsp; I resisted <a
name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 152</span>the
impression, and said to myself, it is all nonsense; I will not
give way to superstitious fears.&nbsp; Again the warning was
impressed on my mind, and I then paused and lifted up my heart in
prayer to God.&nbsp; I had no sooner done so, than I heard the
postillion contending with his horses, which were plunging into
the hedge on one side of the road; then they dashed to the other
side, and it appeared as though we should have been precipitated
over the side of the hill; but we reached the bottom in
safety.&nbsp; I then said to K&mdash;, &lsquo;I will tell you
what has been passing in my mind,&rsquo; and related to him all
the circumstances.&nbsp; K&mdash; then told me, that just at the
same time, as he supposed from my description of the spot, the
same thing was suggested to his mind, and that at first he
repelled the suggestion, but afterwards yielded to it; but that
he had not the honesty to confess the circumstance till I had
done so.&nbsp; I know K&mdash; well, and feel perfectly assured
that he would tell me nothing but the truth; and from the
remarkable circumstance of the suggestion being made to the minds
of both of us, I cannot, but believe it was an intimation from
above of our danger and of the necessity of prayer.&nbsp; For,
although his angels are always at hand to succour us in danger,
yet God has been pleased to make prayer a necessary means for
obtaining their aid.&nbsp; When I am in my grave, tell this for
the benefit of others as an encouragement to prayer.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My dear young friend and god-daughter adds, &ldquo;I was very
much impressed by the charge with which my dear father concluded,
and, that I might be the better able to fulfil it, I wrote down
the whole relation when I returned home, of which the above is a
copy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I very gladly comply with a hope expressed by Mr.
Mortimer&rsquo;s eldest daughter that I will insert in the memoir
of her dear father, a letter addressed to <a
name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>her by him
when she was about ten years of age; and, as it was written
during his residence at Madeley, I insert it here before we take
leave of that place:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We returned to Madeley on the evening of
last Thursday week; and I am thankful to state that we have all
of us received considerable benefit from our journey.&nbsp; Your
brothers and sisters seemed to enjoy themselves
exceedingly.&nbsp; The latter part of the time we were joined by
your uncle, who spent about eight days with us; and having hired
a car for that time capable of holding eight or nine persons, we
were enabled to see all that was worth seeing in the
neighbourhood.&nbsp; We often wished that you and C&mdash; had
been with us in our excursions; but more particularly while we
were going over the castle of Aberconway, for it struck us as
conveying one of the most perfect ideas of both the extent and
uses of a castle of any we could recollect to have seen.&nbsp;
The town also is surrounded by a strong and turretted wall, and
gives a good notion of a walled city, such as we read of as
connected with former times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We greatly prefer Glan y don to Barmouth.&nbsp; It is
about six miles from Abergeley, in Denbighshire, North
Wales.&nbsp; It is situated in a delightful recess termed
Llandrillo Bay, and the scenery all around is picturesque in the
extreme.&nbsp; Such a pleasing combination of the sublime and
beautiful I have seldom seen.&nbsp; The sea-shore, however, after
all, presented us with the chief attractions.&nbsp; I collected
and fixed the names of many of our English shells, and that also
in a state far more perfect than before.&nbsp; I began also a
collection of marine plants.&nbsp; These I shall have pleasure in
showing to you when you return home.&nbsp; You will be surprised,
perhaps, when I tell you that they amount to upwards of sixty
different sorts, and these are exceedingly few in comparison of
those I should have met with had we been there a longer time, or
had we waited for the equinoctial <a name="page154"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 154</span>winds, which, perhaps you know,
bring the greatest quantity of marine substances to the shore,
tearing them from the rocks to which they adhere and grow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A&mdash; begins to learn the names of a few of the more
common shells, and was much pleased with making an incipient
collection.&nbsp; He has purchased some plain cards, and, after
dividing them by pencil marks into regular departments, he pasted
his specimens upon them; and I think you will say, they look
tolerably well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your aunt &mdash; stopped with us about a fortnight
after you left us, and I accompanied her up to London.&nbsp; The
only coach, which we could with any convenience go by, was
principally occupied by nine convicts, who were being conveyed
from Shrewsbury to London, previous to transportation; and,
during the night, two of them were in the coach with your aunt
and myself.&nbsp; These were two of the most noted pickpockets
belonging to a Shrewsbury gang, and, as you will readily suppose,
we were not at first much disposed to relish their company.&nbsp;
But, as they were ironed and exceedingly well-behaved, we soon
got reconciled to them, and were not a little interested in the
observation of this novel description of character.&nbsp; It
presented, however, a melancholy admixture of ingenuity and
depravity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will be sorry to hear that during our absence at
the sea, poor Mr. P&mdash; died.&nbsp; He dropped down suddenly
while standing in the rope-walk, and never spoke
afterwards.&nbsp; He was advanced in years and his death was
expected; but still, in such an uncertain world as this, who can
be secure?&nbsp; May we all be fully prepared when our summons
shall arrive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You inquire concerning H.&nbsp; He began his letters
while we were at Glan y don; but I cannot say any great things as
to his proficiency.&nbsp; Within these few days we have permitted
him to dine at our table, and he has behaved so very well that we
intend he should <a name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
155</span>continue to do so for the future.&nbsp; L. and P., for
nearly a month past, have been introduced to our morning family
prayer, and I am happy to state that they conduct themselves with
much propriety.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After spending about eighteen months at Yardley, near
Birmingham, exchanging duties with the vicar of that parish, Mr.
Mortimer finally left Madeley and removed to Clifton, August 30,
1826; but the situation not being in accordance with his retired
habits, he took a house at Horfield, whither he removed on the
10th of October of the same year.&nbsp; From this place was
written the letter of which the following is an extract, bearing
date, January 17, 1827.</p>
<h3>TO THE REV. JOHN ARMSTRONG, BUENOS AYRES.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">From</span> my brother, who joined us here
the day after the arrival of your letter, I was rejoiced to find
that Mrs. Armstrong and your family had arrived in safety; for
though your frequent voyages must have familiarized <i>you</i> in
some degree to danger, yet <i>we</i> who encounter nothing beyond
the minor and comparatively trivial perils by land, feel a
something approaching to <i>wondering</i> gratitude at your
seemingly hairbreadth escapes.&nbsp; But possibly I misjudge my
endeared friend.&nbsp; The observation which he has thus had
&ldquo;of the works of the Lord and of his wonders in the
deep&rdquo; has called forth his augmented tribute of
praise.&nbsp; And I trust that being once more surrounded by his
dear family, his comforts will thicken around him, and his sun of
prosperity will become brighter and brighter, and that, if
consistent with the divine will, it may set again no more.</p>
<p>By the commencement of my letter, you will perceive that
<i>I</i> have been wandering as well as yourself; and,
considering the difference of our locomotive <a
name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>powers, I
am almost disposed to regard my own movements as the most
astonishing.&nbsp; Madeley I have entirely given up, and left in
the hands of my dear friend Cooper, than whom, I know not any one
more suited to the place.&nbsp; He is, I find, very
acceptable.&nbsp; I can say but little at present of myself: for
my <i>first</i> object in settling here was the health of myself
and family, which has already, I am thankful to say, been
considerably improved.&nbsp; And now I am waiting for the first
eligible employment which shall present itself in Bristol, that
my renewed health and strength may be devoted to the glory of Him
who has mercifully restored them, and to the benefit, I trust, of
those around me.&nbsp; But though I have not as yet any settled
employment, I am almost constantly engaged twice on the Sabbath,
and, were I not resolutely to refuse, I should frequently be
requested to take a third service.</p>
<h3>TO THE SAME.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Horfield, near Bristol, May 23,
1827.</p>
<p>My much-endeared Friend,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">For</span> with these appellations I must
address you, though the long intervals which I suffer to
transpire between my addresses may perhaps induce the suspicion
that they are not the legitimate expressions of the heart.&nbsp;
But as this is the general, not to say the universal, character
of my correspondence, and as you must, by this time, have had
sufficient opportunities of discovering my weak points, I will
comfort myself with the hope, that though you find me tardy, yet
that you will not regard me as insincere.</p>
<p>Your letter of the 18th of August last was conveyed, I
presume, through some private hand, and did not reach me till
some months after its date.&nbsp; It <a name="page157"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 157</span>contained, as you will perhaps
recollect, the painful accounts of the bereavements which you
have lately been called to endure, in the loss of your two most
beloved daughters; and to one of your disposition and
habits&mdash;one so affectionate, and domestic, and in every
sense paternal&mdash;the dispensation must have been one of no
ordinary suffering; and yet so sweetly do the feelings of the
true Christian combine with those of the sorrowing parent, that I
almost envy you the power which you so blessedly possess; an
attainment to which I look up, when I consider it in reference to
yourself, with admiring gratitude; but which, when I advert to,
in contrast to my own imperfect and limited experience, humbles
me in the dust.&nbsp; Hitherto, indeed, I have had but little
affliction in my family; yet that little has not been borne with
that meek and patient submission&mdash;with that deadness to the
world and that detachment from the creature&mdash;which ought to
characterize the child of God.&nbsp; But if I so readily faint in
the day of comparatively minor sorrows, how can I be expected to
stand in the day of increased and lengthened suffering&mdash;the
<i>evil</i> day, asked for by Satanic malignity, and rendered but
too necessary in order to bring before me the latent evils of my
own unsanctified heart?&nbsp; Still, however, the divine panoply
has been mercifully provided; and what should hinder me from
becoming strong in the Lord and in the power of his might?&nbsp;
I will therefore hope in his mercy.&nbsp; I will expect, that
should sufferings await me, such as those with which my endeared
friend has been visited, I may still be enabled to glorify my God
in the day of my visitations; and then all will be well.&nbsp;
For sanctified sorrow not only loses all its pungent and
corrosive, and deadly qualities, and thus leaves our neutralized
minds in the possession of calm and settled peace; but it has
reference also to that happy and eternal state above, where all
our light and <a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
158</span>momentary afflictions shall be succeeded by that
inconceivable weight of glory which shall suffer neither
diminution nor end.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Mr. Mortimer&rsquo;s next engagement in the duties of his
sacred office, was at St. Mary le Port, Bristol, first undertaken
temporarily during the serious illness of the regular minister,
the Rev. Thomas Grinfield, which lasted for some months, and
afterwards sharing the services with him for a year, before his
going to the curacy of Hutton.&nbsp; He entered upon this duty
for the first time, on Sunday, December 10, 1826, and continued
in the discharge of it until the end of September, 1828.&nbsp; In
this sphere he seems to have laboured with peculiar pleasure,
acceptance, and usefulness; his talents as a preacher appear to
have been better appreciated, and his services more valued, than
in any other situation that he filled either before or
afterwards; and, speaking after human judgment, I cannot help
regretting that ever he felt it to be his duty to leave a field
of so much promise, and one which he was so well calculated to
improve and cultivate; and, if I do not greatly mistake, his own
mind was not entirely free from feelings of regret on this
subject.&nbsp; Of his adaptation to the place and of the benefits
resulting from his ministry there, he was not himself
insensible.&nbsp; He thus writes to his sister, Mrs. Holland,
August 5, 1828:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In my ministerial duties it has pleased the
Lord to give me a degree of acceptance among my present charge
which I was never favoured with before.&nbsp; At Madeley, indeed,
the attendance was good, and as much of interest was kept up and
spiritual benefit conveyed, as kept my naturally anxious and
misgiving mind from quite sinking; but in Bristol it has been far
otherwise.&nbsp; The attendance at church has greatly increased;
the affection of the people seems to be given me in an unusual
degree; and I do hope the blessing <a name="page159"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 159</span>of the Lord keeps bringing home the
word with power to their hearts.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He makes reference also to his labours at St. Mary le Port, in
a letter to the Rev. John Cooper, in terms which sufficiently
indicate his own feelings and sentiments, and which are plainly
expressive of his own judgment upon a comparative view of his
services at Bristol with those performed elsewhere.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Hutton, near Cross, Somersetshire,
Feb. 4, 1829.</p>
<p>My much-endeared Friend,</p>
<p>I <span class="smcap">am</span> quite ready to acknowledge my
faults; and lest, through forgetfulness, I should in a similar
manner offend in this instance also, I am determined to despatch
my communication at once.&nbsp; You kindly allude to
gratification received from this source in time past.&nbsp; Such
hints coming even from an indifferent quarter, always frighten
me; they make me fancy that something will of course be expected
for the future; and knowing so fully the mere business-like
strain in which I am generally accustomed to write, and my want
of spirituality when I touch upon serious subjects, I have such a
shrinking, not to say horror and dread of letters of mere
friendship, that while intending to pay my just and lawful debts
in this department, I keep insensibly postponing their discharge,
till I fancy my answers would be out of date, and would fain sit
down with a quiet and contented mind.&nbsp; Creditors, however,
are those merciless kind of beings that it is no easy matter to
escape out of their hands, and ever and anon some upbraiding or
threatening communication appears in due form before me.&nbsp;
Not, however, that I could be so wanting in urbane feelings, as
to speak in such terms of Madeley despatches; they are, of
course, the merest and most gentle of all mementos&mdash;all
lapses of time are so graciously <a name="page160"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 160</span>overlooked, and the most unblushing
halts on the part of the most notorious offender are rather
implied than expressed.&nbsp; You will therefore be kindly
pleased to accept my most humble and grateful acknowledgments for
such unmerited mercy; and hoping for ever to profit by such
benignity, I now beg leave to conclude my lengthened
exordium.</p>
<p>As you appear to have seen my good friend Y&mdash;, you have
no doubt heard from him most of the particulars connected with my
recent change.&nbsp; I do, indeed, most fully believe, that I am
in the spot to which I have been most evidently directed of the
Lord; and in respect to outward comfort and suitableness of
employment, I suppose I should hardly find another situation
equally eligible; <i>but</i>, <i>after all</i>, <i>I cannot help
regretting the termination of my Mary le Port
engagements</i>.&nbsp; Much kindness have I received in various
forms from my Madeley people&mdash;much also, and most strongly
expressed, from my temporary charge at Yardley; <i>but I never
seemed to live so fully in the hearts of any of my people as
those</i>, <i>from whom unavoidable circumstances have so
recently separated me</i>.&nbsp; I am persuaded, however, that
all is right both for me and for them; and if developing
circumstances should not reveal this to the eye of sense, yet
that faith which brings its luminous atmosphere around the
results of cautious procedure and humble dependence will cheer
the mind with its present assurance, till it shall conduct us to
that world where, without the least shadow of a misgiving, we
shall acknowledge that our guiding and gracious Saviour
&ldquo;hath done all things well.&rdquo;&nbsp; My outward path
has indeed, for some time past, been in many respects somewhat
mysterious and painfully perplexing; but such are frequently the
movements even of those who not only have the cloudy pillar to
guide them, but who also are careful to follow its
guidance.&nbsp; And, even allowing that <a
name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>ourselves
have not thus followed with this undeviating step, still we have
the privilege of penitent return; and, from whatever point we may
retrace our wandering step, we see the same heavenly guidance
before us, waiting to conduct us onward in the unerring way.</p>
<p>I feel much obliged for your interesting allusion to Madeley
procedures; your dispensary, infant-school, and clerical meeting,
have all of them, not only the approval of my judgment, but of my
heart. . . .&nbsp; And therefore I do, in all respects, most
sincerely rejoice that the kind and gratifying permission of
which you speak was ever given to me.&nbsp; My fear, however, is,
lest you should be doing too much, encouraged by that
<i>half</i>-untrue and sadly delusive maxim, &ldquo;Better to
wear away than to rust away.&rdquo;&nbsp; I would rather have you
patronise that far more prudential substitute suggested by the
biographer of Leigh Richmond, &ldquo;I labour less that I may
labour longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I do indeed most sincerely rejoice with you in the blessed
testimony afforded to you by your endeared and dying sister, to
the faithfulness of our gracious and Omnipotent Redeemer.&nbsp;
How few are the families where the leavening influence of true
religion has been more extensively or more blessedly
experienced!</p>
<p>We had not heard of the arrival of our Ceylon friends till
your last reached us.&nbsp; Most truly rejoiced shall we be to be
permitted to meet them; but the notorious offender has some
draw-back to his anticipated pleasure&mdash;a four or five
years&rsquo; <i>halt</i> keeps haunting his perturbed mind.&nbsp;
Nor let your gifted men of punctuality smile, as they read these
compunctious movements&mdash;these reiterated
confessions,&mdash;lest our insulted spirits spring from beneath
the ignominious tread, and, elate with all the consciousness of
our newly acquired powers, hold ourselves in readiness to repel
the charge and to retaliate the affront.</p>
<p><a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>You
have heard, I suppose, of my having taken three pupils to
instruct with my own children; my time, as you can readily
imagine, is far from sluggishly employed; my health, however, is,
and has been for some time past, through God&rsquo;s blessing,
unusually good.&nbsp; Within the last three weeks, I have been a
little threatened with a return of Madeley feelings, but this has
been through attempting too much.</p>
<p>Our united and very kindest love attends Mrs. C. yourself, and
family, and</p>
<p style="text-align: center">I remain, my dear Friend,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Yours, ever affectionately,<br />
G. <span class="smcap">Mortimer</span>.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The next step in the life of my endeared friend, which comes
under our notice, is one which filled all his friends with
surprise&mdash;one which they could not contemplate without much
concern&mdash;one, the expediency of which, they could none of
them fully perceive&mdash;one, indeed, which they could not but
consider as uncalled for and unnecessary.&nbsp; I refer to his
leaving England, and proceeding with his family to settle in
Canada.&nbsp; At an earlier period of his life he appears to have
been animated with a pure and holy zeal for the cause of missions
to the heathen, and would, if his way had been open, most gladly
have entered upon that self-denying service.&nbsp; But now he was
not stimulated by such a motive; indeed, he can hardly be said to
have made even ministerial duties his chief object: it was not to
seek a new fortune in the vineyard of Christ, but to improve his
worldly fortune for the temporal benefit of his children.&nbsp; I
do not presume to censure Mr. Mortimer for this step, though I
agree with many of his friends in considering it a very
questionable measure.&nbsp; He was not like a man in needy
circumstances; Providence had supplied him with a very
comfortable <a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
163</span>independent income; one perfectly adequate to provide
for all the reasonable wants of his family, and to enable him to
place out his children in suitable situations, as they grew up;
much more so, if I do not greatly mistake, and with much greater
satisfaction, too, than he has been able to do in Canada.&nbsp;
Where the object is the cause of God, I should be among the first
to recommend a man to leave his home, his friends, and his
country, and go to the very ends of the earth, if called to such
a service; and I see no reason why men of business, if their
disposition lead to it, though they possess even good properties,
should not expatriate themselves for the purpose of commerce, or
the increase of their fortune; but I hesitate as to granting the
same liberty to the minister of Jesus Christ, especially where it
has pleased his heavenly Father to furnish him with the necessary
supplies of life in a tolerably competent measure.&nbsp; It is
clearly the duty of a clergyman, as it is that of a layman, to
make such provision for his family, in the event of his removal
from them, as his circumstances will permit; but to make this the
first object of consideration in determining upon an important
movement in life&mdash;in leaving one&rsquo;s own country and
settling in another&mdash;does seem to me not very
warrantable.&nbsp; Upon these considerations, I cannot, I
confess, perfectly concur with my late beloved friend in the
measure under contemplation.&nbsp; No doubt he was fully
satisfied in his own mind of the propriety of the step on which
he had determined, and that the accomplishment of it was in
accordance with the path of duty and the order of Providence.</p>
<p>But let Mr. Mortimer speak for himself.&nbsp; Four, out of the
five following letters, touch more or less upon the subject, and
explain his views of the measure and of the desirableness of
it.&nbsp; In the dark view taken in some of these letters of the
prospects of <a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
164</span>his native country, the writer of them by no means
stood alone; and though commerce seems to have recovered itself,
and the prosperity of the nation has assumed a more promising
aspect, yet the encouragement given to Popery by the State on the
one hand, and the movement in the church towards the increase of
its ranks, and the augmentation of its influence on the other;
the unmanageable state of pauperism, and the ungovernable, and, I
fear, to any considerable extent, the unimprovable condition of
the peasantry and the poor of our great cities, cannot be
contemplated by the Christian patriot without fear, alarm, and
consternation.&nbsp; We are evidently in the state of a volcano,
and everything seems to indicate a no very distant eruption,
which may rase the foundations of the Church and State, and
scatter misery and wretchedness, rapine and bloodshed, murder and
destruction, over the face of the land.&nbsp; The elements of
some general convulsion are preparing with a rapid progress; and
awful, it is to be feared, will be the catastrophe, if, by timely
repentance, the blow which threatens us, and which undoubtedly we
deserve, be not averted. <a name="citation164"></a><a

<h3><a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 165</span>TO
THE REV. JOHN ARMSTRONG.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Hutton, near Cross,
Somersetshire,<br />
Nov. 1830.</p>
<p>My dear Armstrong,</p>
<p>I <span class="smcap">do</span> indeed feel myself much
obliged to you for kindly breaking through the impediments which
my lengthened silence put in the way of our renewed
intercourse.&nbsp; I often reproached myself for not writing; and
yet there seemed such an awkwardness in recommencing, that I fear
I should never have had courage to combat with it.&nbsp; But your
truly welcome letter has opened my way, and I most gladly avail
myself of the unexpected facility.&nbsp; But before I proceed to
other matters, I ought to assure you that yours is not any
personal or any peculiar or isolated case.&nbsp; All my friends,
and even relatives, are successively neglected; and if it were
not that so many of them are touched with a similar feeling of
kindness with yourself, and ever and anon renew the needful
impulse, I should soon be forsaken by them all, and find myself,
what I so richly deserve, &ldquo;a desolate old man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All your topics of communication cheer me.&nbsp; I truly
rejoice with you in the erection of the church.&nbsp; It was a
noble emprise, characteristic of my endeared friend, and
peculiarly owned and blessed of his God; of its extent of good,
eternity will alone unfold.&nbsp; Your account also of your dear
children was read by me with much interest, and with real
gratitude.&nbsp; How faithful is God.&nbsp; In the spirit of the
Levite you have thrown up your inheritance among your
brethren.&nbsp; And some of us, not sufficiently aware of the
nature or extent of your faith, and but little called to tread in
similar paths, were inwardly dreading some disastrous
shock.&nbsp; But the whirlwind, the earthquake, and the fire,
were only the creatures of our own <a name="page166"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 166</span>imagination; while all that is real
is &ldquo;the still small voice&rdquo; of our God, proclaiming,
as is usual with him, to those who can trust him, his goodness,
and his love.&nbsp; May the same goodness attend all the other
branches of your dear family.&nbsp; And may you and your beloved
wife be long spared to them, to the church, and the world.</p>
<p>I know your friendly feeling would prompt you to enquire
respecting our several movements.&nbsp; But where shall I
begin?&nbsp; All is and all has been well with us; and yet much
has been transpiring which we little anticipated.&nbsp; The calls
of our family have induced struggling and self-denial.&nbsp; My
curate could not be retained.&nbsp; The tutor for my children,
when he left for college, has not been replaced.&nbsp; First, his
duties devolved on me; then the extra care of three pupils.&nbsp;
Removing, too, has been attended with loss.&nbsp; And various
other matters have all been tending toward the same point.&nbsp;
But still I would reiterate the declaration&mdash;all is and has
been well with us.&nbsp; To some spirits, struggling and
difficulty is absolutely necessary.&nbsp; Like stagnant waters,
they must be shaken, or they will acquire the evils consequent on
inactivity.</p>
<p>I have for some years past been endeavouring to feel my way as
to a settlement in one of our colonies; having little expectation
of being able to settle my children at all advantageously in
England.&nbsp; All I wished for was something in the shape of
ministerial duty, without much regard to the emolument, but as a
kind of satisfaction that I was not going out of the way of
usefulness.&nbsp; But my inquiries were fruitless.&nbsp; Indeed
my friends were not over anxious about my success.&nbsp; They
mostly inclined to my remaining in England; and therefore did
not, I believe, at all exert themselves.&nbsp; Now I begin to
fancy that I am getting too old for such an experiment.&nbsp;
Though possibly should anything desirable present itself, I <a
name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>should not
wonder at my old feelings reviving.&nbsp; But I should not now be
tempted, I think, with anything short of a chaplaincy; and these
are so far from being come-at-able, that I consider my emigrating
schemes as at an end.&nbsp; My views, however, with regard to my
own country are still the same.&nbsp; I was never a national
croaker; and have, I think, always been disposed to look at the
bright side.&nbsp; Still I can anticipate nothing but rapidly
increasing distress, and not very far distant ruin.&nbsp; And
this has almost invariably been the case with great commercial
nations.&nbsp; The influx of extraneous wealth, producing such
increase of population, and such extent of luxury, and when these
arrive at a certain point, other countries, other markets,
successfully compete, and eventually surpass.&nbsp; At one of
these points we are already arrived, and the retrograde impulse
is beginning to be most painfully felt.&nbsp; All classes,
indeed, are much suffering at present; and had it not pleased God
to have given us a popular king and a most plenteous harvest, it
is most generally believed that a revolution would ere this have
taken place.&nbsp; Many, I know, are still dreading it.&nbsp; A
letter which I received but a few days since from a General, a
father of one of my pupils, is strongly expressive of the
feelings which still prevail in the metropolis.&nbsp; To add to
other causes of apprehension, we have just received the account
of the resignation of the Wellington ministry.&nbsp; All is
indeed perplexity.&nbsp; But still the Lord Omnipotent reigneth;
all is in his hands.&nbsp; And possibly what we are dreading is
only the small cloud of needless apprehension, which will either
soon blow over, or only discharge itself in unexpected and
undeserved mercies.&nbsp; But why should I allude to public
events; for, with letters from your friends, you receive, no
doubt, a budget of the public papers, which bring all these
matters before you in all their diversified aspects and
bearings.</p>
<p><a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>As to
my ministerial employments, I feel on the whole comfortably
engaged.&nbsp; My sphere is but small; and my success not very
apparent; and yet circumstances seem to require my continuance;
nor does any moving of the cloud point out any other place.&nbsp;
I therefore go labouring on; and should it please God to fix me
eventually in some other situation, I shall find all the benefit
from my past exertion; for I make a point of preparing one new
sermon every week.</p>

<h3>TO THE REV. JOHN COOPER.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Hutton, January, 1831.</p>
<p>My dear Friend,</p>
<p>I <span class="smcap">am</span> much obliged by your kind and
prompt communication respecting the removal of poor Mr. Burton,
your vicar.&nbsp; I am afraid it will prove the precursor of many
difficulties, both with regard to yourself and beloved
Madeley.&nbsp; We must look, however, beyond these probable
perplexities with that steady eye of faith on the promises and
perfections of our ever faithful God, which shall enable us not
only eventually, but at each successive movement, to feel the
grateful persuasion that all is well.&nbsp; I hear from Mrs. D.
W&mdash;, that Mr. B&mdash; gives her some encouragement to hope
that your continuance there is more than probable.&nbsp; Should
any aid be required under such an arrangement, I shall be happy
to continue the &pound;10 yearly which I have already devoted to
this object, and I beg you will not feel the least scruple in the
transfer.</p>
<p><a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span>I
have been, with much contrivance, plotting an arrangement for you
in conjunction with myself and Mr. H&mdash;, but one or two
matters would not, I fear, fall in with your wishes, and
therefore I have let this slip.&nbsp; I have written however to a
dear friend to be on the look out for you, and shall try to call
in other aid, as well as keep an observant eye myself.&nbsp; I
feel persuaded that mercy is still in reserve for my much
endeared friend.&nbsp; Mrs. M&mdash; unites with me in very
kindest regards to yourself, Mrs. C&mdash;, and your family,
and</p>
<p style="text-align: center">I remain,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Yours, ever affectionately,<br />
G. <span class="smcap">Mortimer</span>.</p>
<h3>TO THE REV. JOHN COOPER.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Hutton, Aug. 9, 1831.</p>
<p>My dear Friend,</p>
<p>I <span class="smcap">did</span>, indeed, intimate to Miss P.
my intention to write to you at an early opportunity, and I am
quite ashamed and sorry that I should have delayed doing this so
long.&nbsp; Your very kind and most interesting letter, received
a few days since, has not only opened my eyes, but warmed my
heart; and, even were I disposed any longer to postpone, I should
find it somewhat difficult to do it.</p>
<p>I do, indeed, most sincerely rejoice with you in all the
goodness and mercy which have attended you during your residence
in Madeley.</p>
<p>You kindly and delicately suppose that the incipient
attentions showed you, on your first going there, were in some
measure from their kindly feelings towards myself.&nbsp;
Possibly, the glowing descriptions of a friend might have
prepared the minds of many for <a name="page170"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 170</span>expectation, and have procured for
you the more than ordinary courtesies of introduction.&nbsp; But
such expectations would have terminated in all the vexation of
contrast, had there not been that suitableness in my dear friend
which I had supposed, and which the parishioners were in no way
backward to discover.&nbsp; It is with much gratitude to our God
and Saviour that I look back on the whole of the past
transaction: the circumstances which seemed indispensably to
require my own separation from the dear people of Madeley; their
hopelessness respecting a suitable successor; your willingness to
accept the charge; the kind vicar&rsquo;s willing consent; and
the long interval of reciprocal endearment which has since been
experienced&mdash;one so cordial, and so thorough * * * and,
surely, that most munificent and touching act of their kindly
feeling and high respect which they showed you on your departure,
is no small proof of the accuracy of my supposition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hitherto hath the Lord helped me,&rdquo; may be the
encouraging motto of my friend.&nbsp; And greatly will it rejoice
me to hear that in his new, and yet more extensive sphere of
labour, the same distinguishing mercy from on high attends him:
you go accompanied with many prayers, and encouraged with many a
cheering recollection of the past; and, what is more comforting,
I will freely acknowledge, to my own mind, you go onward with a
humble sense of your own nothingness; surprised at the results of
mercy which you see; pausing, not in self-congratulation, but in
lowly gratitude, to survey and express them.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * * * * *</p>
<p>The account which you give of the new vicar is very
encouraging, and answers, in all respects, to the other
testimonies which have reached me.</p>
<p>The times seem peculiarly perilous, both politically and
ecclesiastically; though I was never given to <a
name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
171</span>&ldquo;croak,&rdquo; yet I cannot but feel that we are
on the eve of danger.&nbsp; God only can avert it, and in Him is
my hope; but <i>out</i> of Him everything seems gloomy and
foreboding.&nbsp; Could my dear wife see and feel with myself, I
think it probable, that I should make some effort to escape from
all this stormy wind and tempest, to some one or other of our
colonial shores, and there endeavour to establish my family under
more auspicious promises than those afforded by our native land:
for the mercantile day of England has long been declining, and
with our increasing population no very cheering prospects can be
cherished. <a name="citation171"></a><a href="#footnote171"
class="citation">[171]</a>&nbsp; My way, however, is not yet
clear; and till my path is opened, I feel no desire to
proceed.&nbsp; With your own large family, thoughts of the future
will no doubt, at times, be attempting anxiously to
intrude.&nbsp; But I know full well the accustomed sobriety of
your mind, and can easily imagine how quietly and peacefully you
leave these bewildering anticipations with Him who has encouraged
us to cast all our care upon Himself.&nbsp; In this, as in other
respects, may I ever be endeavouring to follow you.</p>
<p>We are truly glad to hear of Mrs. C.&rsquo;s amended health,
and of the comfort which you have in your residence and
situation.&nbsp; It seems, indeed, in all respects, the very
place for you, and long may you and your beloved wife be spared
to <a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
172</span>reside among them.&nbsp; Our united and very kind
regards attend you both, and all the members of your dear
family.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Believe me ever to remain,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Your very sincerely attached,<br />
G. M.</p>
<h3>TO THE REV. JOHN COOPER.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Hutton, March 6, 1832.</p>
<p>My dear Friend,</p>
<p>I <span class="smcap">believe</span> you are almost the only
one to whom this peculiar and endearing appellation is considered
by me as truly belonging, who has not as yet been made acquainted
with my intended movements.&nbsp; Had it been at all practicable,
I should have taken you in my way, in my late lengthened tour to
Hull, Raithby, and London; but circumstances would not then admit
this, and I cannot now indulge the hope.&nbsp; A similar tour,
about eight years since, found you in Liverpool, and my residence
in Shropshire; and then I was permitted to enjoy with you a few
hours.&nbsp; But much as my spirit has always been refreshed with
the pleasing and profitable intercourse with yourself, a few
hours lately would have been particularly valued by me; for I
know not whether such may ever again, in this world, be afforded
me; my late tour having been a leave-taking visit previous to my
finally leaving this country for Ohio.</p>
<p>I know not what your views may be on the subject of
emigration, for I do not recollect to have touched upon it in any
of our conversations.&nbsp; My own mind, however, has, for many
years past, been directed towards it, and I have only been
waiting for the most eligible opportunity of putting my plans
into execution.&nbsp; My three sons go with me in the first <a
name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 173</span>instance,
and in a few months after, my dear wife and three
daughters.&nbsp; Our mutual friend, the Rev. Josiah Pratt, has
written to Bishops Chase and McIlvaine, about ministerial
employment, and I expect to hear from them soon.&nbsp; But, I
understand, there is a great want of Episcopalian ministers
throughout the United States; they are, therefore, gladly
welcomed, and handsomely supported, so that I have no grounds to
fear in this respect.&nbsp; The climate also of the State, to
which I am intending to proceed, is considered as very fine and
healthy, and living is little more than one half of what it is
even in country places here.&nbsp; In addition to these
advantages, I hope, with God&rsquo;s blessing, to find
remunerating employment, and suitable settlement for my
children&mdash;a matter which has been long perplexing me, and of
which there is certainly no prospect in this country.&nbsp; I had
intended at first to have made an extensive purchase of
uncultivated land, which, in the inland States, is selling for
two or three dollars an acre; but this plan I have relinquished;
for my ministerial avocations, and the settlement of my children,
together with the enjoyment of suitable society, were hardly
compatible with a situation surrounded by uncultivated
districts.&nbsp; I am thinking of sailing from Liverpool, in
preference to Bristol, as I hear that the accommodations are much
superior, and the time of sailing more certain.&nbsp; Do you know
any friend there to whom you could obligingly write yourself, or
recommend to me to apply to, who would be so good as, first to
make enquiries about the packets, and <i>finally bargain</i> for
me?&nbsp; I wish to sail as soon as I can after Easter-day, April
22; and I want five cabin places, for myself, three sons, and a
pupil, or proteg&eacute;.&nbsp; During your residence in the
vicinity of Liverpool you may, probably, have become acquainted
with some persons now resident in America, to whom an
introduction <a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
174</span>might prove to me of considerable service.&nbsp; It is,
indeed, held forth as the land of liberty, prosperity, and
religion; but there is no place in which we shall not find the
need of friends; and, especially, will they be valuable in a
strange land.&nbsp; If, then, you could obligingly help me in
this matter, I should feel much indebted to you.&nbsp; I am
particularly desirous of getting my books exempted from duty, if
I possibly could.&nbsp; I have diminished these, with many a
shrinking feeling, to about one-third of their number; but, even
now, there are four hundred weight, and the duty is one shilling
and three pence per pound, on <i>bound</i> volumes, the chief of
which mine are.&nbsp; Books are, in fact, my implements of trade;
almost all of them either ministerial or scholastic; and as the
common artisan is permitted to take his tools, why should not the
minister and tutor his?&nbsp; Perhaps, the justness of this would
be allowed on our arrival at New York, if I could be put in the
way of obtaining it.</p>
<p>Strange and startling, perhaps, as my projected movements may
seem to you on their announcement, I shall not venture to ask you
whether revolving months or years may induce my Madeley successor
to follow my steps.&nbsp; Unprepared, however, as he may be, at
present, for such a scheme, even in imagination, it would be no
matter of surprise to me, should he, ere long, be as fully
persuaded as myself of its expediency.&nbsp; Beneficed clergymen,
who have charges they cannot without much cost, either of
feeling, or temporal sacrifice, detach themselves from, may see
it their bounden duty to remain; those, also, who have connexions
which may help to settle their children in after life, or those
who have only one or two children to provide for&mdash;these may
still linger in their once prosperous, and ever endeared country;
but the unbeneficed&mdash;unpatronized heads of large families
must, I fear, sooner or later <a name="page175"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 175</span>decamp.&nbsp; &ldquo;Our hive&rdquo;
(as our mutual friend Mr. Pratt, observed to me) &ldquo;is too
full, and we must lead out our respective swarms.&rdquo;&nbsp;
But may the God of providence and grace ever guide us, and,
wherever we either go or remain, may He both &ldquo;bless us, and
make us a blessing.&rdquo;&nbsp; Our very kindest love attends
yourself, dear Mrs. C., and your family, and I remain,</p>
<p style="text-align: center">My dear Friend,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Yours, ever sincerely,<br />
<span class="smcap">George Mortimer</span>.</p>
<h3>TO THE REV. JOHN COOPER.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Hutton, June 6, 1832.</p>
<p>My endeared Friend,</p>
<p>I <span class="smcap">leave</span> Hutton to day for Bristol,
and expect to go on board the brig <i>Active</i> for New York,
to-morrow; and, as my only remaining means of communication, I
take up my pen to bid you adieu.&nbsp; Had I sailed from
Liverpool, as I was once intending, I should certainly have
endeavoured to have spent a few hours with yourself and family;
but the expenses of travelling and of conveying luggage so far
across the country, together with the higher charges in the
Liverpool vessels, obliged me to consult my purse rather than my
feelings; and I am persuaded that my endeared friend will not be
the first to censure me.</p>
<p>We are now proceeding to Upper Canada by the way of the United
States; and though the climate is somewhat colder in winter, and
hotter in summer, than our own, it is considered as very fine and
healthy.&nbsp; To myself also it has this no small
recommendation, that it is under British Government, and is
principally inhabited by British settlers.</p>
<p>I have used all endeavours to procure ministerial <a
name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>employment
there, but as yet in vain.&nbsp; Our present leading men are too
liberal to give support to any religious object; and the Canada
company prefer the recommendations which arise from local
knowledge and representations.&nbsp; But on this latter account,
I still hope, that when I arrive there, I shall not be long
before I hear of some situation or other in which I may be
usefully employed.&nbsp; Some desirable introductions to
residents have been kindly afforded me.</p>
<p>The want of religious instruction is almost the only drawback
from the Canadas.&nbsp; In many instances persons are thirty or
forty miles from a place of worship.&nbsp; This, however, is no
small call on the superabundant labourers among ourselves; and I
do expect, that ere long this call will be fully regarded.</p>
<p>And now my endeared friend, what shall I say as to all the
comfort&mdash;the unmixed satisfaction&mdash;which, for so many
years, I have been permitted to enjoy in our occasional
intercourse?&nbsp; To our gracious and faithful Redeemer let us
give all the praise!&nbsp; And may we ever be looking forward to
the time, when the friendship of earth shall be followed by the
blissful and never terminating enjoyments of heaven.</p>
<p>Mrs. G. M. begs to be united with me in kindest remembrances
to yourself, Mrs. C., and family, and I remain, my endeared
Friend,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Yours, ever sincerely,<br />
<span class="smcap">George Mortimer</span>.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Mr. Mortimer and his three sons set sail on the 11th of June,
1832.&nbsp; He gave an account of his passage to America, of his
reception in Canada, and of his first impressions and
expectations there, in the following letters to Mrs.
Mortimer.</p>
<h3><a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span>TO
MRS. MORTIMER.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Aug. 6, 200 miles from a Port.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">June</span> 12th, Tuesday, 9
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; Driven from the cabin by disposition to
sickness, I write on deck on one of the hen coops.&nbsp; Last
night all of us fell giddy and beginning to be
squeamish&mdash;took the brandy in sips and all were immediately
relieved.&mdash;Herbert also lost his head-ach.&nbsp; Our nightly
abode was, I confess, an uninviting concern.&nbsp; When I lay
down I seemed as though I should be suffocated and was obliged to
rise up in haste, but soon got reconciled, and managed, at last,
to get off and slept pretty well till five.&nbsp; The wind has
been favourable ever since we sailed, the captain in good
spirits, nothing could be better.&nbsp; At nine, yesterday
evening, we cast anchor; the captain, in consequence of the
haziness of the weather, being afraid of proceeding, lest, not
being in open sea, he should run foul of land; we resumed
operations, however, between two and three.&nbsp; The ship
remaining stationary was the cause of the close and confined
sensations which we had on getting into our berths at night; for
when the vessel is in motion there is no want of fresh air and no
feeling of oppression.&nbsp; I am again, my dearest Mary, on
deck.&nbsp; I have just been humming over three or four times my
favourite verse,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;O may I ne&rsquo;er forget,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The goodness of the Lord;<br />
Nor ever want a tongue to spread,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His loudest praise abroad.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ah! we called upon him in our trouble, and he hath delivered
us out of our distress: we could, therefore, &ldquo;praise the
Lord for his goodness and for his <a name="page178"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 178</span>wonderful works which he showeth to
the children of men.&rdquo;&nbsp; I had scarcely finished writing
the contents of the first side of my sheet, when the wind began
to veer round, and blowing from the west with great violence, the
ship heaved and rolled to such a degree, that the whole of the
passengers, without exception, were taken so suddenly and so
distressingly ill, that they were obliged to dash, as quickly as
possible, to their beds&mdash;no time for undressing, and none,
of course, for arranging our little alleviations and preventives
against sickness.&nbsp; Our party were all differently affected,
but all suffered much for about twelve hours.&nbsp; Arthur was
quite unconscious of what he did&mdash;Cecil occasionally
incoherent&mdash;Herbert very quiet, but at times greatly
suffering.&nbsp; Indeed, I had serious thoughts, whether we
should ever recover; but I lay musing, and praying, and casting
the weight of my oppressed spirits on my covenant God in Christ
Jesus, and soon had a most blessed state of peace.</p>
<p>Sunday, June 17, 12 noon.&nbsp; We have just had service on
deck&mdash;an interesting scene, and seemingly not unacceptable
to the auditors, who, in pleasing and attentive groups, were
lying, or rather sitting, round me.&nbsp; We had three or four
good singers.&nbsp; Hymn,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;God moves in a mysterious way.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Text, Gen. xii. 1.&nbsp; The deck presents quite a Sabbath
scene, most of the men either reading or quietly sitting.&nbsp;
God openly honoured.&nbsp; Wind greatly against us, out nearly a
week and only 200 or 300 miles from land; but I have no
restlessness, indeed scarcely a wish; peace more than
usual.&nbsp; On deck we fared but badly, the spray besprinkled
most in their turn.&nbsp; One wave, more unmannerly than the
rest, drenched the mate, soaked the captain, and soused myself
and Cecil and Herbert.&nbsp; We shook ourselves as well as we
could, and sat quietly till we were dry.&nbsp; The mate says he
has been thirty-one voyages and. never knew <a
name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>such rough
weather at this season of the year.&nbsp; In the evening, all was
calm and we ate in quietness, and with good appetite, a meat
supper, followed by biscuit and cheese, and supported by our good
bottled porter.</p>
<h3>TO MRS. MORTIMER.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Brig <i>Active</i>, August 13,
1832.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">This</span> day week, I forwarded to you
by the ship <i>Science</i>, Greenock, three letters, written at
different times during our voyage.&nbsp; After reading my third
it seemed so vapid and uninteresting that I determined to
discontinue my journal, and, of course, my extracts from it; for,
though many things seem interesting to us in our isolated and
pent-up situation, yet, when soberly reviewed, they amount to a
mere nothing.&nbsp; As, however, we are now approaching the
shore, I am desirous of having a letter nearly finished that I
may forward it as soon as possible after our arrival, should it
please God to permit us to reach the much longed-for shore.&nbsp;
The last week has been one of much anxiety and perplexity to most
of the passengers.&nbsp; The ship we spoke with told us we were
out in our reckoning, and this communication proved but too
true.&nbsp; We thought we were within 200 miles of land, but it
then appeared we were distant between 500 and 600.&nbsp; Our
provisions and our water had already begun to fail, and many on
board had been reduced to very short allowance.&nbsp; Judge,
then, of the feelings which prevailed when our actual distance
was ascertained.&nbsp; The <i>Science</i>, indeed, spared us half
a barrel of flour, but what was this for our increasing
necessities?&nbsp; The privations, therefore, have daily become
greater, and, to such a degree has murmuring and dissatisfaction
prevailed, that a mutiny by many is daily expected.&nbsp; The
Lord, however, is in this, as in <a name="page180"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 180</span>everything else, the all-sufficient
God, and he will still continue to protect and to bless us.&nbsp;
And, indeed, since I last wrote to you, we have had many and most
striking instances of his watchful and paternal care.&nbsp; On
one occasion we were exposed to the most terrific storm of
thunder and lightning, which we had ever witnessed, and its
nearness was so great, that we appeared in immediate danger of
being shattered to pieces.&nbsp; Upon the most accurate
calculation, it was at one time only a quarter of a mile distant,
and if it had actually passed over our vessel, loaded so
extensively with iron, the consequences would, in all
probability, have been fatal to us all.&nbsp; During the last
week we fell in with the fog, and one of the West India Island
hurricanes, terrific and awful beyond previous conception: it
must be witnessed to be fully understood.&nbsp; Towards its close
I ventured upon deck, and truly thankful was I to learn that no
damage had been sustained, no mast shattered, not a single leak
sprung.&nbsp; Some, indeed, attributed this to the tightness and
excellence of our fine little vessel, overlooking the goodness
and faithfulness of our God.&nbsp; Ah, how it grieves me to the
heart to see the loving-kindness of our God so generally lavished
upon us in vain!&nbsp; But the confinement of a ship calls into
exercise almost every latent quality of the mind; the secrets of
hearts are indeed most fully revealed, though the exhibition is
by no means gratifying.&nbsp; In many respects, however, it is
useful, and I feel very thankful for it as it regards our little
party.&nbsp; Habits and dispositions have unfolded of which I had
scarcely the least idea, but which discovery will materially
influence me as to the steps which should be taken in reference
to my future movements and the eventual disposal of my
children.&nbsp; We are now, I believe, about 100 miles from land,
and it is well that we are no more; for most of our comforts have
failed us in the cabin, and we are brought under allowance as to
<a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>water,
and they speak of this as to other provisions; so that we manage,
as you may suppose, but badly; and were we to continue much
longer in our present state, I fear that our health would
materially and even permanently suffer.&nbsp; But we make the
most of what remains, and keep cheering ourselves with the hope
that it will not be for long: the wind, however, is far from
favourable, and we proceed with great slowness.&nbsp; Nine weeks
to-day have we been out at sea&mdash;I should rather say, since
we set sail&mdash;and few calculated upon a longer time than five
or six weeks; so that it is not surprising many among us are
beginning to suffer.&nbsp; But, as I mentioned, hope sustains us,
and the God of love and mercy will, in his own good time,
extricate us out of all our troubles.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Delaware River, August, 1832.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> are at length, dearest Mary,
through the good providence of God, brought about midway up the
river on which the city of Philadelphia stands; but, in
consequence of the cholera still prevailing there, we shall be
obliged to perform a short quarantine of two or three days in a
place about twelve miles on this side of it, and after that we
may possibly be detained, previous to our passing the Custom
House, for a day or two longer.&nbsp; In less than a week,
however, from the present time we are hoping to proceed to New
York, and thence on our Canada journey.&nbsp; Like the great
Apostle we should thank God and take courage.&nbsp; Many have
been his tender mercies towards us, and I feel a calm and blessed
power to resign all the future into his hands.&nbsp; We have just
passed a most beautiful village (Newcastle), built completely in
the English style; but everything now is so fresh and novel that
we view it with tenfold interest.&nbsp; We are all, thank God, in
very good health, <a name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
182</span>and the cholera has considerably abated at New
York.&nbsp; I should hope we are running no risk in proceeding in
our intended line, and, indeed, no prudence would be any
sufficient safeguard, for I hear that it has spread to very many
of the surrounding places, and therefore there is no possibility
of getting entirely out of its way; but that God, who directed
our steps through the United States, will, I am confident,
preserve us.&nbsp; I have been reading twice with great attention
a small work of Dr. Granville, which has thrown great light upon
my mind, both as to the origin, treatment, and prevention of the
disease.&nbsp; It was given by Mr. Grant to Arthur, and I
consider it quite providential that it was thrown in my way.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Philadelphia, August 22.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">And</span> so, my Mary, through the mercy
of my God, we are brought at length to the long-wished-for shore,
and the thrilling feelings of pleasure which we experienced as we
stepped once more on land were half delirious&mdash;it seemed
scarcely a reality.&nbsp; In a short time, however, the delirium
of joy subsided into a most delightful state of peaceful
gratitude.&nbsp; We came here yesterday afternoon, and soon began
to reconnoitre; passing from street to street in rapid
succession, and for the first time since I left England I was
thoroughly tired, but at the cost of my poor bleeding toes, which
were so sore that I could hardly put on my shoes, but on they
went, and a little after five I awoke our party to proceed on
fresh adventures.&nbsp; The first exploit was in the
captain&rsquo;s boat, which he kindly lent to us, and a fine
rowing we had across the Delaware to a small island near the
State of New Jersey, where three of the young people enjoyed a
most delightful bath.&nbsp; On our return to breakfast such a
scene of rapacity was exhibited as <a name="page183"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 183</span>would have astonished even an
indulgent and ever apologetic mother.&nbsp; The captain had
previously talked of a good blowing out, but now we experienced
it.&nbsp; Your half-famished eldest son has, I think, taken
precedence, but we were none of us far behind him, with such
relish did we apply to the abundant and novel and delicious fare
which was set before us.</p>

<p style="text-align: right">York, Upper Canada, Sept. 21,

<p><span class="smcap">Nothing</span> as yet has been determined
respecting myself.&nbsp; The bishop was absent on a long tour of
visitation, but I obtained a letter of introduction to Archdeacon
Strachan, through Captain Fitzgibbon; and His Excellency the
Lieutenant-Governor, Sir John Colborne, having heard of my
arrival, expressed a wish that I do wait upon him.&nbsp; Both he
and the archdeacon behaved with great kindness, and mentioned
places which they thought desirable; but I wait for the advice of
the bishop, to whom I have written on the subject.&nbsp; I am
disposed, however, to fix on Hamilton, a rising village near
Ancaster, beautifully situated, and bidding fair to become the
third town in the province, York and Kingston only taking
precedence.&nbsp; No church, indeed, is as yet
built&mdash;service is performed, in the Court House&mdash;but
one is fixed on.&nbsp; My salary will be &pound;100 sterling, a
rectory house, forty acres of cleared land, besides some&mdash;I
forget the quantity&mdash;uncleared, and the sum I may obtain by
letting the pews.&nbsp; The Governor and his lady are both truly
pious.&nbsp; I dined with them on Tuesday and spent a most
pleasant evening.&nbsp; The archdeacon is uncommonly friendly;
our whole party took tea with him on Saturday evening, and I have
called on him since.</p>

MRS. MORTIMER.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Thornhill, near York, Oct. 8,
1832.</p>
<p>I <span class="smcap">do</span> not wish to raise your
expectations in any improper way, but I still think I ought in
justice to say, that I think you will be tolerably pleased with
the situation in which I have been led to settle.&nbsp; There is,
indeed, no fixed salary, and perhaps nothing beyond &pound;40 or
&pound;50&mdash;the sum given by the congregation&mdash;may be
obtained by me.&nbsp; But the Bishop and Governor both expect
that I shall receive from the clergy reserves &pound;100 more,
and, if so, this &pound;150 will be very fair.&nbsp; As to the
distance (only thirteen miles from York) it has a decided
preference over Hutton, and the society is in my estimation far
superior, and mostly English.&nbsp; The church is small, but the
attendance good, far more than the Hutton average.&nbsp; They
appear also quite pleased with my coming, as my predecessor,
though a learned man and a great orientalist, had no aptness for
parochial engagements.&nbsp; I forgot to mention that the spot
and neighbourhood is considered most healthy.&nbsp; If the young
folks are desirous of seeing their future location, they may look
into a map of Canada, and they will see a road leading from York
to Simcoe Lake, directly north; this is called, George Street
Road, each side of which is cleared for the space of two or three
fields.&nbsp; It is on this road that Thornhill is
situated.&nbsp; I intimated in my last letter that I had some
thoughts of building a house to be ready to receive you on your
arrival, but you will be glad to hear, that I have entirely given
up all idea of it; it never will do, at least for me, and
therefore I have made my continuance here depend on the trustees
of Thornhill Church, allowing me &pound;40 or &pound;50 per <a
name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>annum, and
their providing me at a moderate rate a house suitable for my
family, some time before the 10th of June next, 1833, at which
time, through God&rsquo;s blessing, I hope to see you all
here.&nbsp; And surely he <i>will</i> preserve you; not a box, or
package, or anything has been lost, everything brought safe over
the perilous ocean and the intervening space, and shall not the
same faithful God of love preserve my Mary and all her
accompanying charge?&nbsp; I will, therefore, trust, and not be
afraid.</p>
<p>I received a message from the Governor last night, in which he
tells me, I may depend on having the &pound;100 he mentioned to
me.&nbsp; He is peculiarly kind and a great blessing to the
province.&nbsp; The people seem very desirous of detaining me;
Messrs. &mdash; assure me that some house sufficiently large
shall be provided.</p>
<h3>TO MRS. MORTIMER.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Thornhill, near York, Nov. 4,
1832.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">To-day</span>, dearest Mary, when I arose,
I found the first snow lying on the ground, and, as the
thermometer now indicates, that we are fast approaching our
Canadian winter.&nbsp; I have staid at home to-day to get matters
more fully in order, that I may meet it as pleasantly as I
can.&nbsp; A few days previously I quitted my cold, smoky sitting
room, and took up my quarters in my favourite bed room, removing
into it my books, boxes, and in fact everything, except the
chairs and one table, which I have left below to receive company
when they shall honour me with their visits; which, in spite of
my bachelorship, and the non-attractions of my place, they feel
themselves bound in courtesy to do.&nbsp; Think not, however,
that I freeze my visitors, for I too well <a
name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>remember
the cold rooms into which I have been ushered myself, while in
England.&nbsp; Mrs. Crosby, therefore, has received a strict
charge to keep up a fire from ten to five, and when visitors are
expected a semi-mountain of logs is added to the pile.&nbsp; My
bed room has been greatly improved by nailing up three of the
bedding wrappers (and which, for the purpose, I found a most
invaluable treasure), against three of the windows, so as to
exclude all the searching, piercing, cold winds and air, which, I
hear, penetrates so bleakly when the winter fully sets in; for
this aforesaid bed room of mine has no fewer than four windows;
for the Canadians, not being taxed for their lights, think they
can never have enough, and hence we are broiled in summer and
frozen in winter, as the concomitants of our delectable
liberty.&nbsp; I have now, therefore, as you will perceive, only
one window remaining; but this is quite enough, and you would
join me in my conclusion had you to-day seen the snow forcing its
way by some unaccountable means through some imperceptible
apertures, so as quite to wet some clothes which for a few
minutes I had incautiously placed under the window.&nbsp; My
removal to the bed room was the day before yesterday, and the two
last nights were the only two in which I slept comfortably.&nbsp;
I got an extra blanket that was of no perceptible benefit; a
second counterpane was added to the weight of the superincumbent
clothes, but not apparently to the warmth: I then slept in a pair
of silk stockings; but these also, though the best of all my
auxiliaries, were not adequate, and I was therefore obliged to
put over these a pair of my worsted warm socks; but even then I
had a chilly feeling towards morning.&nbsp; Since, however, I
have been sitting constantly in my room, and have had a fire
there, and a good one too, all the day long, lighted before I
rise, and left burning with renewed logs when I go to rest: with
all these helps <a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
187</span>and adjuncts I do now exceedingly well, but what I
shall do in the real winter I know not.&nbsp; Now the thermometer
is not lower than 20&deg; or 25&deg; below freezing point in the
night, but then it is frequently 10&deg; or 12&deg; below zero,
and once last year it was 29&deg; below it.&nbsp; Perhaps I shall
have recourse to the Russian fashion, and sleep with the feather
bed over me, or between the blankets, but even then, poor nosey
and its neighbours will receive no benefit, and the gentlemen, I
suppose, will complain of the injustice done to them, while all
the other parts are so cozy, and they are left to bounce against
the icy formations produced by the moisture from the breath; but,
as little Herbert would say, we must breathe, and so poor nosey
and company must take their chance.&nbsp; I think I have not, as
yet, alluded to one of the chief Canadian annoyances, the amazing
prevalence of the house fly.&nbsp; All places swarm with them,
and the most respectable persons, who feel the annoyance greatly,
quite despair of getting rid of them.&nbsp; In a few days,
however, I effected a clearance, and afterwards only a
comparatively few stragglers made their appearance, which were
daily removed; and this must be done, if you would have any
comfort.&nbsp; I took up a volume in boards at a lady&rsquo;s
here, which had been lying on its side on the shelves, and when I
touched it it was so rough with the abundance of their excrement,
that I wondered what kind of excrement it was covered with, till
I examined and discovered the cause of the evil.&nbsp; Gauze or
muslin covers most of their things, but as to the mass of them,
they are filthy beyond endurance; and then the creatures keep
buzzing about you incessantly, and keep you in a continual fidget
with their intolerable tickling.&nbsp; Then, again, they almost
cover your plate while you are eating, and as to indulging in a
siesta, that is impossible.&nbsp; If a loaf of bread is left
uncovered a short space, its surface <a name="page188"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 188</span>is so eaten as to appear quite
grated; and all other articles are laid by them under similar
contribution, though it may not be quite so discernible.&nbsp; I
guess that my Mary will be equally zealous with myself in
attempting this clearance.</p>
<p>Mr. &mdash; has just been here; he is one of the trustees of
Thornhill Church.&nbsp; To him and his associates the Governor
has this day made over 600 acres for the use and benefit of the
minister out of the clergy reserves.&nbsp; These they will
perhaps exchange for half the number of acres near the church,
situated on the George Street Road, and when the exchange shall
be effected, they will proceed with the house.&nbsp; You have
heard about the long and still unsettled disputes about the
Clergy Reserves.&nbsp; In Mr. Pitt&rsquo;s administration, a
certain portion of the land was reserved for the clergy in each
township; but the Presbyterians of the Scotch Church and the
other denominations have lately put in their claim, and since the
litigation commenced, nothing has been done, no lands, in any
case here, I believe, have been assigned.&nbsp; His Excellency
wrote to Lord Goderich, and has just obtained from him permission
to assign lands to such clergy as at present are just being fixed
in their respective districts.&nbsp; Sir John is now acting upon
this permission; some lands belonging to the clergy reserves have
been sold to form a fund, in hand, and out of this he builds the
parsonage house.&nbsp; We are much indebted to the Governor, Sir
John Colborne, for his perseverance, without which no adequate
provision for ministers of our church could have been made, for
none of our congregations would hear a word about contributions
as long as there was a chance of the clergy reserves being
obtained.</p>
<p>Oh, how glad I am, my Mary, we came here, instead of going to
the United States, and that the good providence of God directed
us to this country.&nbsp; Depend upon it, we shall never regret
the step we <a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
189</span>have taken, every day convinces me of its expediency,
in every point of view.&nbsp; May the same God of love who
brought us safe and directed us, as the pioneers of our little
party, bless, preserve, and keep those that remain, and bring you
through every perplexity and trial to this land of his peculiar
smile.</p>
<h3>TO MRS. MORTIMER.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Thornhill, Nov. 8, 1832.</p>
<p>I have for the last two or three weeks been expecting another
letter from Locking, and supposing that it would contain various
things which I should like to touch upon in reply; but, as the
roads keep me at home for a day or two, I am unwilling to let
this state of leisure pass by.&nbsp; Yesterday, I returned from
York, having been conveyed there and back by the kindness of a
lady in this place, the weather just held up for the time.&nbsp;
Had we been a day later it would have been terrific work, but I
live in hopes his Excellency the Governor will mend the great
north road on which Thornhill stands.&nbsp; Sir John has
commenced operations both in the town and neighbourhood of York,
and his success there encourages hope in this, though the sum to
be raised for the purpose is &pound;20,000.&nbsp; My reception
among the great in York was gratifying&mdash;the condescension
and kindness of all parties quite surprises me.&nbsp; My abode
was at the hospitable bishop&rsquo;s, who in this, as well as in
all other respects, is a truly Christian bishop: he pressed me to
lengthen my stay, and was almost hurt that I did not
comply.&nbsp; His chaplain is a true Christian, and of very
pleasing manners.&nbsp; When he found that Arthur was residing in
York, he offered me his kind attentions on his behalf, and before
I left he <a name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
190</span>mentioned him also to the bishop.&nbsp; I was much
struck with the pious solemnity with which he put the licence for
Thornhill into my hands; it seemed a real committal of souls to
my charge, so different from the matter-of-course transactions
which I had in all other instances witnessed.&nbsp; Sir
John&rsquo;s party I joined in the evening, dinner six
o&rsquo;clock, not much in this respect to my liking; but
everything else connected with the visit most agreeable.&nbsp; He
has received permission from Lord Goodrich to proceed with the
projected plans for settling the clergy, and he tells me he will
make the commencing trial with myself.&nbsp; When it is more
fully and definitely known to me, I will report to you; but what
I gather at present is, that he will give me as incumbent 300
acres of land, forty of which shall be cleared at his expense,
and a suitable house erected; and he thinks all can be done with
ease for your reception, on or about the 10th of June.&nbsp; He
does not promise me a salary, but, till this be accomplished, the
bishop will try to give me at the rate of &pound;100 per
annum.&nbsp; He however cannot engage.&nbsp; The people promise
me &pound;50 per annum: they are very kind to me, and show me the
greatest attention.&nbsp; The congregation increases, and though
I am not forward to speak upon such subjects, I do feel that the
situation is important, and the Lord has much work for me in this
place.&nbsp; My heart also is in some measure in my work; I feel
it blessed; its former anxieties and oppressiveness are
astonishingly removed, and thus the Lord has at length granted
unto me what I almost regarded as impossible; so that the
anticipated wilderness has been made to smile and blossom as the
rose&mdash;the peace and blessedness within having shed its
transforming influence all around.&nbsp; I had often read the
45th of the Madeley Hymns in reference to the future, but I
little thought how completely it <a name="page191"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 191</span>would be realized.&nbsp; The hymn
begins with, &ldquo;That man no guard or weapon needs,&rdquo; and
the last three verses you will perhaps excuse my
transcribing&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;His love possessing I am blest,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Secure whatever things may come;<br />
Whether I go to east or west,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With him I shall be still at home.</p>
<p>If placed beneath the northern pole,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though winter reigns with rigour there;<br />
His gracious beams would cheer my soul<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And make a spring throughout the year.</p>
<p>Or if the desert&rsquo;s sun-burnt soil<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My lonely dwelling ere should prove,<br />
His presence would support my toil,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose smile is life, whose name is love.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many of the Irish Protestant clergy are coming out in the
spring, with large quotas of their flocks, driven out as they are
by the violence of those who refuse to pay the church
tithes.&nbsp; I met one of this description the other evening at
the bishop&rsquo;s, a warm-hearted and spiritually minded
Irishman; his details were most affecting, but highly
interesting, and I thought I could see a striking providence in
their being thus compelled to flee at this present time to a
country where they were so particularly needed, and where their
own temporal comforts would be so materially increased.&nbsp; The
good bishop quite rejoiced over his anticipated treasure.</p>
<h3>TO MRS. MORTIMER.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Thornhill, January 18, 1833.</p>
<p>* * * The delight of a warm bed the Canadian can fully
appreciate.&nbsp; The other morning <a name="page192"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 192</span>the thermometer stood 18&deg; below
zero, or 50&deg; below freezing point, and during last night I
conceive it must have been much lower: it is now near the middle
of the day, and the glass is only 1&deg; above zero, and yet,
difficult as you may feel it to credit me, it seems to me a mere
nothing.&nbsp; I can hardly imagine that I am in the midst of a
Canadian winter, that horrible and terrible of previous
anticipation: the fact is, that the severe weather only lasts for
two or three days at a time, which is far different from a
continuous season of four or five months, and though sharp and
searching in itself, yet fire, clothing, and due attention, bring
all to a common English temperature; and then the air is so
cheering and bracing that you smile cheerily, rather than feel
oppressively.&nbsp; But, in reality, I can hardly proceed in my
description, not for want of words but of ink; for it not only
freezes in the ink glass while on the table, but after I place it
on the hearth and thaw it, the pen-full freezes while I am
writing; so that I am obliged to stop ever and anon to thaw it in
the pen, and yet with this acme of congelating miseries, I smile
and laugh and go battling on; but all this sounds worse than it
really is, so do not be alarmed.</p>
<h3>ON EMIGRATION.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">TO MRS. MORTIMER.</span></h3>
<p>I <span class="smcap">feel</span> somewhat puzzled as to what
I ought to say with regard to emigration.&nbsp; As to
agriculture, employment can easily be procured in the upper
province, and the wages are good; but the state of destitution in
which some of the families arrive is very distressing, and keeps
them back for a considerable time.&nbsp; I cannot recommend any
family to come out unless they have &pound;9 a head for each <a
name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
193</span>individual.&nbsp; It happened to one young man who had
paid &pound;1. 15s. for his passage to Quebec, and yet with one
and another charge he had only a few shillings left out of
&pound;12.&nbsp; At Kingston I heard of a family of emigrants
whose baggage was sold by auction to enable them to find the
money to proceed to the agricultural districts.&nbsp; If
emigrants can proceed with their baggage, and a few shillings in
their pockets, they soon feel thankful for their altered
circumstances.&nbsp; As to the two men and their families, I must
leave it to your decision, and to influence them as you judge
best.&nbsp; If they come, it should be as early as possible:
leave England in February and get to Quebec in March.</p>
<h3>TO MRS. MORTIMER.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Thornhill, Jan. 18, 1833.</p>
<p>As to emigration I feel at a loss what to write.&nbsp; There
is in fact hardly a man living but in some way or other may
succeed in this fine country, and yet there is scarcely a man who
may not fail and suffer disappointment, so that I dread
recommending; but were I in the condition of nineteen out of
twenty, I would make every effort to come out.&nbsp; Most have to
rough it for about a year; few need do this much longer; that is,
if thoughtful, prudent, and moral: their wilderness soon begins
to smile, and comforts one after another crowd around them.&nbsp;
I must turn to my log-book for something to say on this
score.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Of all settlers the medical profession
seems to have least encouragement; they are worse off than even
ministers; for in this country the population is so scattered,
and the roads so impracticable, that they slave and toil beyond
all endurance for a scanty pittance, and finding so small a
remuneration, <a name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
194</span>they are obliged to merge their professional
engagements into those of the largely cultivated farm.&nbsp;
Should they speculate on more extensive practice and larger
returns in some of the towns there, so many have anticipated
them, that they half starve before they can get into practice,
and, after paying dear for their rashness, are compelled to
return to the country, and to rough it like others in employments
for which their previous habits have but little qualified
them.&nbsp; Another evil is that all the three branches are here
united, there not being a sufficient call to admit of a division;
and then, again, we are all so healthy, excepting, indeed, the
whiskey drinkers, who die by inches, but who have no peculiar
<i>penchant</i> for bitter drugs; so that had it not been for the
cholera, which so extensively visited us, I fear the medical
gentlemen must have had no great cause to congratulate themselves
on their speculations.&nbsp; The best description of settlers are
young persons with or without families, married or single, who
can command about &pound;1000 in cash, and have about &pound;80
or &pound;100 per annum, on which they can regularly
calculate.&nbsp; These can purchase a fair quantity of land in
cultivated districts, where there is good society and English
comforts; can build their house ample, commodious, and
well-looking; and can realize from their farm what will enable
them to live as gentlemen.&nbsp; I know two or three families of
this description, in this neighbourhood, who have freely
exhibited their finances before me, and they are just what I have
noticed above.&nbsp; And if these do well, much more those whose
income is larger.&nbsp; Such are the settlers we most need, for
improvements follow so fast in their train.&nbsp; Capital and
taste are in their case combined, and their respective
neighbourhoods start into notice and comfort.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As to young men of the more respectable order, they must be
willing to go into trade, and in <a name="page195"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 195</span>this they have abundant
encouragement, not so much in specific trade as in the keeping of
stores, both wholesale and retail, and to such they give a salary
for five or six years, and then either take them into
partnership, or else set them up in some country store,
furnishing them with goods on easy terms to begin with.&nbsp;
Farming will not do for young men of this description, till they
are of age to farm for themselves, and then they may begin, if
they have a small capital to purchase land and stock it.&nbsp;
They want very little of any previous training; the advice of
some friend or neighbour on the spot is quite adequate, if he be
of any tolerable capacity.&nbsp; As to settlers I can say little
beyond what I have intimated before.&nbsp; With &pound;10 or
&pound;12 a head, they need not hesitate a moment.&nbsp; The
principal thing is raising sufficient money to bring them far
enough into the country, and without this it is almost cruelty to
say a word to induce them to leave England.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>To finish these remarks on emigration, from one who knew what
it was from his own experience, I shall add one other short
extract from a letter dated Feb. 21, 1835, addressed to Mrs. D.
Whitmore:&mdash;</p>
<p>But with all this improvement in society and literature, the
matter of emigration puzzles me more than ever.&nbsp; Produce is
sadly falling; my wheat I sold last year for 4s. 3d. a bushel;
the same sample would now fetch only 2s. 6d., and all other
farming produce of course in the same ratio.&nbsp; Farmers,
therefore, are crying out that they shall now be ruined.&nbsp;
Stores also abound so greatly, that a very small profit can be
obtained, where competition is so great.&nbsp; Fortunes,
therefore, are not, as they once were, so easily procured; and
most classes of emigrants are sadly disappointed.&nbsp; Those who
come out with ample means will easily succeed; for living is so
cheap, <a name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
196</span>and capital wanted, and amply remunerating interest in
various ways obtained.&nbsp; But then, again, those who already
have fortunes, or ample means, will mostly prefer the good old
country, and well they may.</p>
<h3>TO MISS E. FORD.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Lockport, State of New York,<br />
May 1, 1833.</p>
<p>My dear Madam,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was very unexpectedly but most
joyously that I received your kind communication respecting the
sailing of the <i>Bristol</i>, <a name="citation196"></a><a
href="#footnote196" class="citation">[196]</a> and I lost no time
in leaving Thornhill for New York.&nbsp; I am now on my way
thither, and hope to find a few leisure intervals during my
journey to fill my sheet, reserving merely a small space for a
postscript, that I may communicate, should all be well, the
tidings of the safe arrival of the endeared party: they have much
occupied my thoughts of late, and, sometimes, with too much of
anxious solicitude, for which I have as often felt reproved; for
such has been God&rsquo;s mercy to us hitherto, that it is not
merely infirmity, but positive sin to be distrustful of his
faithfulness and love.&nbsp; I feel much indebted to you and Miss
Ford, for your peculiar kindness to my dear Mary.&nbsp; I am
never surcharged with feeling, I wish it were my habit; but still
great kindness quite affects me, and as requital will be ever out
of my power, I must look to the beneficent and faithful
retributor above, and would give vent to the utterance of my
heart in the language of the holy and grateful apostle,
&ldquo;The <a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
197</span>Lord grant that you may both find mercy of the
Lord,&rdquo; and especially &ldquo;in that day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Your kind present of the newspapers, &amp;c., will be very
acceptable, and yet, perhaps you are hardly aware of the extent
of either our political or literary information.&nbsp; We have
two monthly magazines published in York, and three or four
newspapers, and from New York we have two weekly newspapers,
designed expressly for English readers&mdash;the <i>Albion</i>
and the <i>Emigrant</i>, full of English news and English
literature; so that in a month or six weeks, we have all the
cream of the London and country news, as well as the best of the
lighter articles from the British periodicals.&nbsp; The
<i>Edinburgh</i> and <i>Quarterly Reviews</i> are reprinted at
two-thirds of the English price; also the <i>Christian
Observer</i>, and other standard and monthly and quarterly
works.&nbsp; Messrs. Harper, also, in New York, reprint the best
of the English works in the <i>Family Library</i>, at three and
sixpence each, executed like Murray&rsquo;s, and their series
amounts already to fifty-three volumes.&nbsp; Another series is
furnished by Lee and Carey, at Philadelphia, and a third of a
religious sort at Boston; so that in a few months, when I can
spare a few pounds, I hope to be able to furnish my family with
an extent of literature far beyond my capabilities in
England.&nbsp; Among my own congregation we have also a book
society, well supported and well supplied; we are, therefore, not
a little chagrined when your boasting Englishers think of us as
in a semi-barbaric land of literary destitution: for we not only
feel ourselves a part of the great nation, but regard ourselves
on nearly an equal footing as to the comforts and luxuries, while
in many respects we feel that we have the most decided advantage,
so we warn you not to treat us either politically or personally
with scorn.</p>
<p>On the day I left York, government despatches had just
arrived, which announced the dismissal of <a
name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 198</span>our two
Crown Officers, the Attorney and Solicitor General, owing, it is
supposed, to too great freedom in debate in our House of
Assembly&mdash;the ferment it excited was almost
ludicrous&mdash;&ldquo;<i>delenda est Carthago</i>&rdquo; was
emphatically pronounced.&nbsp; The Whig Ministry must be
annihilated.&nbsp; The province, though hardly prepared for such
a measure, must at once be severed&mdash;such despotism could not
be endured.&nbsp; I acted, as I generally do on such occasions,
as pacificator, and smilingly quoted the well known lines of old
Dr. Byron, in the conclusion of his <i>Bedlamite</i>&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Kill your enemies&rsquo;, kill a
fool&rsquo;s head of your own,<br />
They&rsquo;ll die of themselves, if you let them
alone.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is whispered also that our excellent and deserving governor
(Sir John Colborne) has not escaped censure; this I am truly
grieved to hear, for his services cannot be too highly estimated,
and our province is indebted to him beyond all expression.&nbsp;
I fear, however, that his removal is not very remote; he is too
pious, and too tame a politician, to give satisfaction to the
administration at home; but my contracting limits oblige me
hastily to conclude, and to assure yourself and Miss Ford how
truly I remain,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Yours, gratefully,<br />
<span class="smcap">George Mortimer</span>.</p>
<p>P.S.&nbsp; June 6, New York.&nbsp; Yesterday the dear party
arrived all in health and safety.&nbsp; Never did I feel more
truly thankful.</p>
<h3>TO THE REV. THOMAS MORTIMER.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Rochester, State of New York,<br />
May 2, 1833.</p>
<p>* * * * * * * Your fame, my frater, has long ago reached this
far distant province, and I ought gratefully to acknowledge that
<a name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>it has,
in more instances than one, proved the passport to gracious and
kindly reception.&nbsp; It was to this, I think, that my boys
were principally indebted for the footing they obtained in
Kingston, and many other little turning points of good are
pleasingly associated in my mind with the high estimate and kind
feeling, which has been cherished towards you as a minister, or
an author.&nbsp; Once, indeed, it appeared rather the precursor
of evil; for our good bishop, previous to my introduction,
fancied that I was the <i>actual man</i>; the great Mr. Mortimer
himself, the author, the distinguished preacher in London.&nbsp;
And many a congratulation had he cherished within, to think that
he had obtained so goodly a fish in his Canadian net.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Then you are not Mr. Mortimer from London, the
author.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No, my lord, his
brother.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, only his brother!&rdquo; was the
consolatory adjunct; and the dismayed little man was left in his
own littleness, unpatronized, unbefriended, to make his own way;
and to this day is, in all probability, reaping the bitter fruits
of the unhappy prepossession; for, though his self-complacency
keeps him from concluding, that his diocesan regards him as a
mere blank, yet he cannot but be aware that the rich prize still
remains in the wheel, and which he had fondly imagined had been
proclaimed as his very own.</p>
<p>My ministerial matters, however, notwithstanding this
inauspicious commencement, are pleasingly progressive.&nbsp; My
salary has been fixed by our good governor at &pound;100 per
annum; &pound;20, or &pound;25, I obtain from the rental of pews;
a house is provided for me by my congregation, free of expense;
arid I have a promise of some good glebe land, which, in a few
years, will be of considerable value.&nbsp; My people are kind;
ministrations seemingly acceptable; church and expositions well
attended; temporal matters encouraging; <a
name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 200</span>living
cheap; and two tolerably advantageous purchases secured for the
children; so that the good hand of the Lord appears to be resting
upon me.&nbsp; Indeed, never for a moment, that I recollect, have
I repented of my step since I have been here.&nbsp; Once or
twice, during our voyage, &ldquo;when no small tempest lay upon
us,&rdquo; when the raging billows seemed on the point of
ingulphing us, so great did my responsibility seem, as connected
with the immortal souls of my little unprepared party, that I
almost wished that I had never ventured on the perilous
step.&nbsp; But, never for a moment, since our arrival here, have
I had the least cause to retrace; and my only regret is, that I
did not proceed before.&nbsp; But, perhaps, all is right, as to
time also; and, indeed, when I glance upon some few of the
deterring circumstances which intervened to retard me, I cannot
doubt but that these also were from the Lord; that the deed, the
time, the place, have all been under the direction of an agency
superior to our own; and what a comfort does this assurance
impart!</p>
<p>I forgot to mention, in my last, how much I felt obliged to
Mr. Hartwell Horne, for the sundry introductions, and other
tokens of kindness, which his parcel conveyed to me, just on the
eve of my departure from England.&nbsp; Be so obliging as to
convey to him my sincere thanks.</p>
<p>As to tuition, I have, I believe, myself altogether done with
it.&nbsp; Hundreds of pleasant hours has it, in various ways,
procured me, and during some few of the weeks I have been in
Canada, have my classical studies been resumed with peculiar
interest.&nbsp; This, partly for their own sake, and partly as a
preparation for any opening that might arise in the college, or
elsewhere.&nbsp; But I have now taken my final leave, not in
dudgeon, nor with painful regret; <a name="page201"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 201</span>but in calm surrender to the will of
a superior power.&nbsp; Dear King, was, I think, in his kind and
affectionate counsel in the matter, quite wrong; such employments
are not so much my duty as my snare.&nbsp; The scales have at
length fallen from my eyes, and though I cannot say, I can now
see clearly, yet I see enough to convince me that, for the
residue of my short life, I ought to give myself wholly to my one
grand and absorbing avocation.&nbsp; Let, therefore, collegiate
honours be sought and enjoyed by others.&nbsp; With these altered
views, perhaps, were I permitted to gain the ear of an endeared
relative, whom you well know, I should whisper certain cautionary
monitions in reference to similar points; for though from his
endeared lips the confessed &ldquo;weakness of his heart&rdquo;
has had a charm and a persuasive influence which won my full
approval, yet now that the syren notes can no longer bewilder me,
I see, as in my own case, the snare rather than the duty, and the
couplet of the almost forgotten Dryden, in which he cautions the
aspirant parson, chimes in with my own overlate, but salutary
musings:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Those who contend for place and high
degree,<br />
Are not his sons, but those of Zebedee.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whisper, then, in my stead, in some auspicious moment, to this
endeared individual what I am so desirous to convey; but mind
that you whisper it in tenderness and love.</p>
<p>But my sheet is filling up so fast, that I have hardly left
myself room to assure you of the interest which I still, and I
hope, ever shall feel in all the concerns&mdash;personal,
domestic, and ministerial&mdash;of my endeared brother.&nbsp; His
opportunities of leisure are so few, that I must not often expect
any direct communications, but whenever conveyed they will be
most grateful.&nbsp; Accept then yourself, and convey <a
name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 202</span>to our dear
mother, Eliza, and all your beloved family, the sincere and
warmest love of your ever attached brother.</p>

<h3>TO MRS. D. WHITMORE.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Thornhill, near York, Upper
Canada,<br />
August 18, 1833.</p>
<p>My dear Madam,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> were much indebted to you for
your last most kind and welcome letter: most joyfully was it
received and opened, and with peculiar interest were its
instructive and interesting contents perused.&nbsp; So long and
so closely written a letter, however, must, we fear, have been
sadly trying to your eyes; and we fear this the more, as we learn
from Miss E. Ford, that you have recently been experiencing
somewhat of failure in your sight.&nbsp; We know how peculiarly
trying this circumstance must prove to one, whose enjoyments have
been so principally derived from this source; and we tremble at
the least intimation of its probable diminution.&nbsp; But we
would still say in the language of the man of God, &ldquo;But the
Lord is able to give you much more than this.&rdquo;&nbsp; And,
from what you have experienced under past seasons of privation
and discipline, you may still expect that, should God be pleased
to try you yet further in this most painful visitation, he will
not withhold from you that superabounding grace, which in its
blessed issue of spiritual and eternal good is more than
tantamount to the most valued of our other joys.&nbsp; My
endeared mother, as you well know, has been called to the
acuteness of the same trial with yourself; but, O, how sweetly
does she bear it&mdash;so cheerfully resigned&mdash;so peacefully
yielding all to the <a name="page203"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 203</span>wise and loving discipline of her
kind and compassionate Lord, saying, in the language of her
favourite hymn:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;All that I prized below is gone,<br />
Yet, Father, still Thy will be done.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But to return to your letter.&nbsp; Your decision respecting
York (now Toronto), exactly corresponds with that adopted by
ourselves; and, therefore, we have no intention of going there;
nor, indeed, any present intention of fixing in any other place,
though many outward circumstances are far from being
inviting.&nbsp; We are sadly cramped together in a wooden frame
house, consisting of only four rooms, and these, owing to the
badness of their construction, peculiarly hot and oppressive in
summer and more than usually cold in winter.&nbsp; Nearly half of
our things too are unpacked, and our landing and other places
crowded and littered by the boxes and trunks, which contain them;
in short an air of untidiness and discomfort meets our
long-trained English eye, wherever we turn it, and, at times, our
heart almost sickens at the sight; and, were it not for the
counteracting influence of better feelings, we should adopt some
hasty measure to accomplish a retreat into some situation, which
might authorize the expectation of somewhat more of outward
comfort.&nbsp; On Mrs. M&rsquo;s. arrival we were in hopes of
being settled in a far more suitable abode, and had, in fact,
engaged to take it; but its distance from the church and the mass
of our population was so great, and so many other inconveniences
attended it, that we decided on remaining for the present where
we now are.&nbsp; They promise, indeed, to build for us a small
house near the church, which is to be ready by spring; but their
promises have hitherto been so fallacious, that I hardly know how
to trust to them, and the plan <a name="page204"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 204</span>of the building is so small, that I
am not without strong misgivings, lest we should feel it our duty
to decline it.&nbsp; And if so we must either build for
ourselves, (seldom either a wise or lucrative act), or else, in
true Canadian style, must turn out and seek other quarters.&nbsp;
The people, indeed, are kind to us, and the attendance on my
ministry is far from discouraging; but if they so little prize
the residence and settled ministrations of a clergyman among
them, as to refuse to accommodate him with a plain and commodious
residence,&mdash;while for themselves many of them have built
elegant and spacious mansions,&mdash;they must not be surprised,
if their miscalculating selfishness terminate in his withdrawing
from among them.</p>
<p>Our temporal matters are encouraging; for living here is so
cheap, that our income is far more than adequate to our regular
demands.&nbsp; I have purchased two cultivated farms of 100 and
105 acres, with clearances of forty and sixty acres respectively,
and out of my savings have already paid off the first instalment
of &pound;250, and in a few days hence shall pay &pound;150 more;
in all, &pound;400; so that, through God&rsquo;s blessing, we are
already beginning to reap the benefit of our expensive removal,
and, without being over sanguine, we may perhaps indulge a hope,
that still further mercies are in reserve, if not for ourselves,
still for our dear children.&nbsp; We are very rapidly advancing
as a province.&nbsp; God has been very gracious to us in our
Lieutenant-Governor, Sir John Colborne, a pious, discreet, and
sound intentioned man.&nbsp; Capital also is gradually finding
its way among us; so that we are beginning to attract the notice
of our jealous neighbours, who see the rudiments of a vast empire
rising up close beside them.&nbsp; And, hitherto, we have been
singularly prospered.&nbsp; A radical party, however, of
considerable strength is, as you will perceive by the public
prints, beginning to trouble us: it is <a
name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 205</span>headed by
the discontented worthless &mdash;.&nbsp; Without this drawback,
we might almost be tempted to exclaim, &ldquo;O nimium
fortunati.&rdquo;&nbsp; But I must conclude.&nbsp; Our kindest
and united love attends yourself and all your party, and</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Believe me,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Yours, ever gratefully,<br />
<span class="smcap">George Mortimer</span>.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>It is not without considerable hesitation that I have
determined to insert the letter which follows in the Memoir of
Mr. Mortimer, not only because he might not himself have fully
concurred in the publication of it, but because there may be a
difference of opinion as to the expediency of it.&nbsp; The
subject, however, is, in my mind, one of such importance to the
interests of the church in Canada, that I should not think I had
done my duty were I to exclude it; and I am happy to say that, so
far as the subject itself is concerned, I have the full
concurrence of some who, from their experience in the
ecclesiastical affairs of Canada, are fully competent to give
counsel in the case, and who perfectly agree with myself in
thinking that a much larger spirit of liberality is necessary,
not only to the extension, but also to the support and prosperity
of the existing church in that country.</p>
<p>There can be no greater benefit to a community, nothing to
contribute more to its general well-being, than an adequately
supported and efficient church establishment.&nbsp; It is the
foundation of everything really good and great, useful and
advantageous, honourable and praiseworthy.&nbsp; It is the grand
means of promoting religion and morality, peace and good order,
charity and good-will, kindness and sympathy between the
different ranks in society, diligence and industry, subordination
and allegiance <a name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
206</span>to the powers that be: in a word, everything that can
make a nation happy and prosperous in itself, and respected by
neighbouring countries.&nbsp; The duty, therefore, of making
strenuous efforts for the accomplishment of so desirable a
purpose must be apparent to all who feel the paramount necessity
of religion, and to all such, perhaps, it may be apparent; but
the difficulties of every infant colony are urged in bar against
it.&nbsp; These difficulties are fully admitted, and due
allowance made for them; neither is it the intention of the
writer to say one unkind or unreasonable word on the subject; his
design is rather to encourage for the future than to condemn for
the past, feeling, as he does, very forcibly, the circumstances
of trial and privation with which the settlers of new colonies
are for the most part surrounded.&nbsp; Bodily support&mdash;food
and raiment&mdash;must necessarily be had in the first place;
but, except to this, I should be disposed to say, that to no
other could a provision for religion be second; for not more
necessary is food and raiment to the body than the offices of
religion to the soul: indeed, the supply of these wants is
equally necessary, and where they are not simultaneously provided
for, but where the former is over and exclusively cared for, it
is more than likely that the latter will be neglected for years
to come.&nbsp; Under the difficulties, however, in which
emigrants to a newly formed colony find themselves, it seems, in
the first place, the plain duty of every state to provide for the
support of religion in their infant settlements, or, where this
is withheld, it clearly becomes the duty of private Christians,
possessed of wealth and competency, either individually or
incorporated into societies, to afford, as far as may be, the aid
required.</p>
<p>Happily for Canada much has been done for it in this way;
first by the state, and now by the contributions of a more
private and voluntary kind, and <a name="page207"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 207</span>especially by the venerable Society
for the Propagation of the gospel.&nbsp; But a country ought not
to be always looking to and depending upon such adventitious
assistance; she ought <i>at some time</i> to rise above
eleemosynary aid, and make an effort to provide for her own
spiritual wants.&nbsp; The enquiry then naturally arises, Whether
Canada is, or is not, become of sufficient age, or standing, or
competency, to take upon herself the responsibility of supporting
for her own use and benefit the services and ordinances of
religion?&nbsp; I should unhesitatingly reply, that it is more
than time that a beginning were made to throw off the state of
childhood and reliance, and to assume that of manhood and
independence.&nbsp; But are there to be found in Canada more than
<i>a very few</i> towns, and those too only of the first class,
that have taken upon themselves to provide altogether for their
own church establishments?&nbsp; Wherefore?&nbsp; Because there
are not more that are capable of doing so?&nbsp; I fear this
would not be found to be the real state of the case.&nbsp; Mr.
Mortimer&rsquo;s statement is much more likely to be the correct
and faithful one.&nbsp; I feel assured that there are many towns
or townships which might have done much more than they have
towards this great and honourable work.&nbsp; What! shall the
Presbyterians, the Independents, the Roman Catholics, in towns of
a second-rate class, support entirely their own churches and
ministers, and shall Episcopalians constitute the lagging party,
the one most backward in this most blessed and holy
work;&mdash;nay, shall the American Episcopalians, dwelling on
the very borders of Canada, and therefore little differing in
their circumstances from those living in the colony, support
their own religious establishments, and shall the English
Episcopalians be found deficient?&nbsp; Surely this does not
speak much either for the liberality or the churchmanship of our
Canadian countrymen.&nbsp; If we claim a pre-eminence <a
name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>for the
reformed and catholic Church of England, all the members of that
Church should be pre-eminent in their attachment to, and zealous
in their support of it; they should not be behind any others in
their gifts and graces, waiting for the coming of the Lord Jesus
Christ.</p>
<p>Let every reader, then, of Mr. Mortimer&rsquo;s Life, ask
himself, have I done what I could?&nbsp; Have I contributed
liberally, with a willing mind, according to my ability, towards
the erection, enlargement, or in giving comfort and convenience,
and a suitable appearance to my church?&nbsp; Do I dwell in my
ceiled house, while the house of God lies waste?&nbsp; Am I
anxious to see all things about the house of God and the services
of religion done decently and in order?&nbsp; And do I take my
share in the management of the secular affairs of the
church?&nbsp; Am I sufficiently anxious to promote the comfort
and well-being of my pastor?&nbsp; If he have sown unto me
<i>spiritual things</i>, is it a great matter that he should reap
my <i>temporal things</i>?&nbsp; More than persuaded, confident I
am, that if every member of the church of England in Canada would
seriously lay this subject to heart and urge upon himself the
great duties connected with it, much more would be done there to
promote her interests, and to make her independent of all
extraneous aid.&nbsp; All might contribute more than they do;
some in money, some in lands, and they who could give neither,
might give of the produce of their lands, or the fruits of their
labour, or occasionally their labours to assist in tilling their
pastor&rsquo;s grounds, or in planting and cultivating their
gardens.&nbsp; Depend upon it, that he who feels adequately the
real benefits and blessings of being taught in the word, <i>will
minister unto him that teacheth in all good things</i>.&nbsp;
Pastors should not be unreasonable, and, if they be right-minded,
they will have no wish to lay unnecessary burdens upon their
people: but <a name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
209</span>their people, if their minds be duly influenced by
religion, will be as desirous to provide for them, free of all
charitable support, as to maintain their own families in perfect
independence.</p>
<p>Besides, the good Churchmen of Canada should really consider
the many and great calls now made upon that source from whence
their church receives its chief support; I mean, the Society for
Propagating the Gospel.&nbsp; It has only been by renewed efforts
and extraordinary exertions that the society has been able to
maintain so great an expenditure in Canada; perhaps, too, at the
expense of withholding very important help from other needy parts
of our extensive colonial possessions; and it is not reasonable,
nor generous, nor just, to require assistance one moment beyond
what is absolutely necessary.&nbsp; Every township, therefore, in
the colony should begin, with as little delay as possible, to
make its own provision for the public worship of God.</p>
<p>Verily, earnestly do I pray that the foregoing remarks,
together with the letter of my late dear friend, which has
elicited them, may be kindly received, deeply felt, and earnestly
followed, not only by good resolutions, but by personal and
immediate exertions for the gradual accomplishment of a work so
truly honourable to those who promote it, so fraught with
blessings to generations yet unborn, and so full of glory to
God.</p>
<h3>TO MISS E. FORD.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Thornhill, near York, Upper
Canada,<br />
Oct. 17, 1833.</p>
<p>My dear Madam,</p>
<p>You express your surprise at the reluctant support afforded to
ministers.&nbsp; This is partly to be ascribed <a
name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 210</span>to that
selfishness which is so sadly prevalent in our fallen nature;
they can build (commodious and even sumptuous) houses for their
own prosperous families; they can call, out of their perpetually
increasing means, comforts of every description; but, to their
minister, they can calmly and gravely say, &ldquo;Oh, you must
wait patiently, and in time all will be right; we have had to
wait before you; it is quite impossible to force matters in
Canada,&rdquo; and so on.&nbsp; And then, in the spirit of that
affected benevolence which prompted that hypocritical wish,
&ldquo;be ye warmed and be ye clothed,&rdquo; they point us to
eventual comforts, and care not to make the least sacrifice which
may conduce to the attainment of the end.&nbsp; In regard to
house, to salary, and to everything pecuniary, I have experienced
scarcely anything but disappointments, and at times I feel a
little piqued at the contrast between their warm expressions of
regard, and their unwillingness to contribute to the comforts of
my family; for, as to myself I care but little; but still I would
not wish to be hard upon them, for though they have property,
very few have money, and as soon as they procure this, they sink
it in the further cultivation or stocking of their farms.&nbsp;
And then, again, they have that admirable loop-hole for
escape&mdash;the clergy reserves, which seemed to promise
everything, but have done scarcely anything; a broken reed, which
is perpetually piercing those who lean on it with sorrow; but
which affords our people so ready an excuse for refusing to come
forward to our aid; so that of all classes of emigrants,
ministers, in a pecuniary point of view, are by far the worst
off: they cannot, with propriety, go into the woods, for they
must fix in the more populous and more cultivated districts,
where land of course is high, and thus one of the chief sources
of prosperity is cut off; and, as to trade, from this of course
they are excluded, but still they are the class of settlers most
needed.&nbsp; <a name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
211</span>And, in the midst of occasional pique and
disappointment, I cannot but feel thankful to God who directed my
steps to this country, and who, by the property which he has
previously given to me, gives me the prospect of enjoying, in
this land of cheapness, a great increase both of comfort and
temporal prosperity.&nbsp; At present, indeed, we are anything
but outwardly comfortable: the house we formerly mentioned was
found too inconvenient, and therefore given up, and we are still
in the lodging I occupied previous to the arrival of my
family.</p>
<h3>TO THE REV. THOMAS MORTIMER.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Thornhill, Toronto, Upper Canada,<br
/>
July 14, 1835.</p>
<p>My much-endeared Brother,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> were in some measure prepared
for the communication conveyed to us by your letter of the 20th
of April, and which reached us yesterday evening; for our
Shropshire friend had heard the report of our beloved
mother&rsquo;s departure, and had made allusion to it in
communications received some weeks since.&nbsp; Well, her happy,
holy spirit, is at length released.&nbsp; Fulness of days has
been granted to her, and, though they have not been unattended
with labour and sorrow, yet has her kind Saviour been with her,
and as much of outward alleviation and inward serenity and peace
have been experienced by her as her circumstances and state of
body would admit of.&nbsp; And now has she entered into the
fulness of her gracious reward, and her sainted name must ever be
inhaled as the precious perfumed ointment, by all who know how to
estimate her deep, consistent, and exalted piety.&nbsp; And where
shall we now look for her fellow?&nbsp; For the race of the
distinguished and peculiar few seems now to have become
extinct.&nbsp; In vain shall we <a name="page212"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 212</span>look for a Cooper, a Rogers, a
Fletcher, a Lefevre, or one like our equally distinguished
mother.&nbsp; A prophet indeed is no where so little esteemed as
among his own kindred.&nbsp; And yet I am persuaded that there is
that in the heart of my endeared brother, which will fully
respond to the encomiums which have thus unintentionally escaped
me. * * *</p>
<p>Your letter bears the goodly inscription of &ldquo;Thornhill
Parsonage;&rdquo; but, alas! it is a sound without
locality.&nbsp; It exists in my kind brother&rsquo;s imagination,
but nowhere else.&nbsp; A house indeed has long been talked of,
and was at length erected, but a mere laical abode.&nbsp; But I
am happy to say that matters are now likely to be on a proper
footing.&nbsp; I have purchased four acres of land (at &pound;50
an acre!!) near the church, for which the Lieutenant-Governor in
Council has consented to allow me an equivalent in wild land, as
well as for a sum not exceeding &pound;500 for the erection of a
parsonage.&nbsp; And operations have commenced, but when they
shall be terminated I know not.&nbsp; The lumber must be sawn and
seasoned, and continue seasoning till next spring, and we are
told that a finished habitation will be ready for us in the fall
of the next year, October the 1st, 1836.&nbsp; But what a distant
period! my hand misgives me while I write it; for my whitened
locks and weakly frame point to a far different abode.&nbsp; May
my affection combine with my judgment, and may my short residue
of days be so numbered by me, that wisdom&rsquo;s lessons may
both diligently and effectually be learnt!</p>
<p>When I sat down I was purposing a tolerably close imitation of
your own very lengthy (eleven-lined!) epistle, and was about to
find some convincing, or at least plausible, reason for my
shabbiness.&nbsp; Happily, however, my pen has kept sliding on;
and finding myself so near the conclusion of the third side of my
closely written sheet, I may assure you with a <a
name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 213</span>tolerably
fair and unblushing front, of our unabated and most affectionate
regards to yourself and all your endeared family, and not least,
those of your sincerely devoted brother,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">George
Mortimer</span>.</p>
<p>P.S.&nbsp; Our kindest love also to all our endeared
relatives.</p>
<h3>TO MRS. D. WHITMORE.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Thornhill, August 21, 1835.</p>
<p>* * * * * Your account of dear Mr. &mdash;&rsquo;s increasing
infirmities, and their necessary effect on yourself and Mr. G.
W., has given rise to many a pensive, perhaps I ought to say,
melancholy, feeling.&nbsp; Indeed, I hardly dare think of the
breaking up of connexions, comforts, health, and so on.&nbsp; My
foolish heart too frequently deceives itself with delusive
hopes.&nbsp; I say, too generally, &ldquo;I shall die in my
nest&rdquo;&mdash;the soft downy nest of easy pleasant
dissolution.&nbsp; But when anything reminds me of the thorn, the
sharp-pointed, piercing thorn, which is mostly found there, then
I start, and my spirit almost sinks within me; and I have little
either of manly fortitude, or of Christian magnanimity; at least,
the subject is so unwelcome, that I rather turn from it, than
submissively await it.&nbsp; At times, indeed, I feel willing
that the taking down, the unpinning of the tabernacle, and the
loosening of all its cords, should take place under any
circumstances which my gracious God shall appoint, and I feel a
persuasion that his faithful love will so adjust everything, that
he will in nowise &ldquo;suffer me to be tempted above what I
shall be able&rdquo; to bear; and it is to this point that I have
of late so frequently directed my <a name="page214"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 214</span>prayers, that all the preparatory
circumstances of death, the undoing of that which has been
inexpediently or criminally pursued, the pulling down of vain and
worldly hopes, the detaching of the soul from even the last of
its too-much-clinged-to objects, the patient endurance of the
bodily evils which, as the precursors of death, in some shape or
other await me; that all these may be so met, and so peacefully
and cheerfully borne, that, instead of grieving the Spirit of my
God by any unhallowed feelings, I may surrender everything with
cheerfulness, and endure all in his blessed order.&nbsp; For the
melancholy fact must not be withheld from you, that, after all I
have known, and felt, and preached, I shrink from very many of
the circumstances attendant on dissolution: and what, perhaps,
will surprise you more, and what I am still more ashamed to be
obliged to acknowledge, is, that I am frequently conscious of a
kind of latent infidelity, as to the reality of the coming
world.&nbsp; I do not absolutely disbelieve; for revelation
assures, and all my reasoning confirms, and yet it is one of
those points on which I am constrained to say,&mdash;&ldquo;Lord,
I believe, help thou my unbelief.&rdquo;&nbsp; But how I have
ventured to touch upon these topics I hardly know; for I
carefully keep them from my own self, hardly daring to
acknowledge their existence; and I am so ashamed of them, that I
keep them still more carefully from others.&nbsp; And yet it has
produced a strange relief to me, thus explicitly to advert to
them; it has given to them more precision of shape and locality;
I see with more distinctness what my enemies really are, and I
seem encouraged to hope that, by the grace of God, even these may
be overcome: and I trust also, that, by thus unfolding these
weaknesses of my nature, I shall awaken in my kind friend that
decree of sympathy, which shall call forth from her an occasional
prayer on my behalf.&nbsp; I never <a name="page215"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 215</span>more needed prayer, nor never so
much estimated its value, as I have done of late; it is truly
wondrous in all the branches and bearings of its beneficial
influence.</p>
<p>But I must turn to other matters.&nbsp; I often think of your
self-imposed silence when we were leaving England, evidently not
approving of our step, and yet not wishing to enter into any
enlarged reasoning or discussion; and I as often think, was my
endeared friend right in her non-approval?&nbsp; I am ready to
acknowledge, that we were never so out in our calculation as in
many of the results of our Canadian migration; and in the
estimation of observant friends we must appear, I should think,
to have strangely missed our path.&nbsp; And yet so marked are
all the leading circumstances which have transpired, that we
cannot, for a moment, question either the permissive or the
appointing mercy of our God.&nbsp; It has been of essential
benefit to myself; it has been of especial good to &mdash; also;
her views and feelings have undergone a most material change, so
that I quite marvel at the wise and gracious process; and in
various ways has the removal been beneficial to our
children.&nbsp; But all this is hidden from outward observation;
no one perceives either the needs-be, or the result, but the
outward appearance it is which puzzles them&mdash;all is
completely in contrast with our former selves, and so little in
accordance with our property and with what we have a kind of
right to expect in the shape of accommodation from our
parishioners.&nbsp; We would, indeed, without much difficulty,
should we see it to be our duty, bring ourselves into altered
circumstances; we could retrace at once our migratory steps and
reach our native land richer by, at least, a thousand pounds than
when we left it.&nbsp; We could also leave our present
unaccommodating people, purchase or build on some advantageously
situated spot, retire from the peculiar awkwardnesses of Canadian
<a name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
216</span>ministrations, and more privately exercise, without
cost to any, the exposition of God&rsquo;s word, and the visiting
of the sick and needy.&nbsp; We might also build, at once, in
this place, at our own cost, and, without pecuniary regret, let
slip a few hundreds of pounds on the impolitic speculation of
procuring somewhat more of suitable and becoming
accommodation.&nbsp; We might dash also through some others of
our temporary unseemlinesses, and be able to write in an altered
and more gratifying strain to our now wondering
friends&mdash;might encourage our sons, for example, to launch
out into avocations, or attempt other branches, which, while they
have more appearance of gentility, would only sap the foundation
of their future respectability and comfort.&nbsp; We might do all
this and much more, and pride would suggest its partial or total
performance; but we should be either forcing our way, or
premature in our movements.&nbsp; Grace and duty bid us calmly
and patiently to await God&rsquo;s time; and we are not without
hope, that he will at length bring us into his wealthy
place.&nbsp; All is well: with our hearts, we can say so, and
with this conviction, we may and ought to be content.&nbsp; And I
say this, not to justify our procedures (for this really has
become to us a very small matter), but to bring an endeared
friend into a more correct estimate of what is actually passing
among us&mdash;to show her that, while discomfort appears to be
in some respects outwardly surrounding our little edifice, much
of God&rsquo;s blessing, with peaceful acquiescence and comfort,
is still found within.</p>
<p>I need make no mention of the termination of our endeared
mother&rsquo;s earthly career, on whose account we are at present
in mourning; we have heard no particulars of her last moments,
nor, indeed, are these necessary in order to assure us that her
end was blessed.&nbsp; You and ourselves have known her in her
married life, and in her widowed state.&nbsp; But even in <a
name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 217</span>this her
limited sphere, we have seen her as a most distinguished and
honoured servant of the Lord; but, from all I have heard and
read, almost all the brilliancy conspicuous in her unmarried life
was then suffering an eclipse; and so those of the brightest and
most dazzling rays of the Miss Richie of former times, were
nearly forgotten in the conjugal and domesticated Mrs.
Mortimer.&nbsp; Her life, you know perhaps, is in the course of
publication, and I shall look for it with much interest.&nbsp; I
fear, however, that it will be wanting in incident, though her
diary, which she has kept for many years, may supply much of
unexpected material.&nbsp; Her published letters I read many
years since with peculiar pleasure. * * *</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Yours,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">My dear Madam, ever gratefully
obliged,<br />
<span class="smcap">George Mortimer</span>.</p>
<h3>TO MISS E. FORD.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Thornhill, July 28, 1836.</p>
<p>My dear Madam,</p>
<p>I <span class="smcap">am</span> becoming so sadly neglectful
of my duties, as a correspondent, that I not only richly deserve
from my friends their censure, but a total discontinuance of
their kind communications.&nbsp; To yourself and respected
sister, however, my neglect assumes the aspect of ingratitude;
you have so diversified and heaped on me your kind and delicate
attentions.&nbsp; I can say so little that is apologetic, that I
will not make the attempt; but, as in my approach to a Higher
Power, I would at once acknowledge the fulness of my delinquency,
and solicit from your united kindly feelings that indulgence
which I am in nowise entitled to expect.&nbsp; I trust, however,
that <a name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
218</span>your forbearance will not be exercised in vain, and
that it will be long before I again trespass to a similar
extent.</p>
<p>But though I have no apology to offer for my long silence, it
may in some measure be accounted for in the present uncertain
state of our affairs; for I have long been hoping that something
definite would arise, and I was unwilling to write to you
before.&nbsp; But week passed on after week, and we are still in
statu quo.&nbsp; The B&mdash;s have probably informed you of our
intention to remove to some other situation, for the sphere is
exceedingly limited, and the church-people unusually few; so
that, after a four years&rsquo; trial, I should hardly feel
justified in spending my little residuum of strength in a spot
where the deficiency of proportionate result is so great.&nbsp;
Our accommodation, too, in our confined lodgings, are far from
suitable, and all our personal attempts, as well as expectations
from others to amend them, have hitherto failed.&nbsp; This minor
matter, indeed, would not, of itself, have been sufficiently
strong, to induce us to remove, but, taken in conjunction with
all the other matters, I have, at length, felt it my duty either
to fix in some other mission, as our cures are here denominated,
or else to retire altogether from public to more private
engagement.&nbsp; I have written to our good bishop on the
subject, expressing a preference for the vicinity of our
children, or some more southerly and more genial part of the
province near the lake shores.&nbsp; He has kindly promised to do
all in his power to meet my wishes, but he has not hitherto been
able to succeed, and we are waiting the result of his further
endeavours.&nbsp; You have heard enough, I doubt not, of our
political affairs to need any enlargement on this point.&nbsp;
Very nearly, indeed, were we on the point of provincial
ruin.&nbsp; But through God&rsquo;s mercy the decision and good
sense of the Lieutenant-Governor <a name="page219"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 219</span>have saved us from anything
immediate, and, I hope, also, from ultimate evil; for there is a
strong conservative feeling brought into exercise, which is not
very likely soon to subside.&nbsp; In our last Parliament, which
the Lieutenant-Governor dissolved, there was a large Radical
majority; but from the recent return for the ensuing Parliament,
out of sixty-two members forty-four are Conservative, and only
eighteen Radical; so that we have good reason to expect an
amended state of things.&nbsp; It will be months and years,
however, before we attain to a sound, healthy, and flourishing
state; for emigration is very nearly at a stand; capitalists, of
course, have no courage to venture among such a set of
revolutionary ruffians.&nbsp; The less monied, who are compelled
to go somewhere, proceed to the States to the far west by
hundreds and thousands.&nbsp; Labourers and mechanics not only
turn aside from us, but leave us after settling among us from
want of employment, or, rather, from want of money to pay them
for their labour.&nbsp; Toronto, for months past, has had quite
an appearance of gloom; so many shops shut up, and so little
trade done; and other towns complain in like manner.&nbsp;
Farming, too, where farming labour is paid for, is so losing a
concern, that, if it were not absolutely necessary for the supply
of their family in country places, there is scarcely a gentleman
but would give it up.&nbsp; I have annually lost by
mine&mdash;little indeed, but still, lost; and the general cry
among my neighbours is, Nothing is to be got by farming.&nbsp;
Indeed, were it not for the comparative poverty of the settlers,
the tide of emigration would soon set homewards: but, to realize
the means of return would, on a general scale, be impossible;
were they to attempt to sell, no sufficient number of purchasers
could be obtained, and the sum realized would go but a little way
towards living in the same style in England; so tarry they <a
name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 220</span>must.&nbsp;
Still, the hearts of many are turning towards their beloved
country, and they would soon rejoin their friends if they
could.</p>
<h3>TO MRS. WHITMORE.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Thornhill, near Toronto, Upper
Canada,<br />
November, 12, 1836.</p>
<p>* * * * During most of the time since I last wrote to you, we
have been in great uncertainty concerning our movements.&nbsp; At
one time I felt so sinking under my ministerial duties, combined
with the peculiarities of the climate, that my wife and Cecil
were strongly urgent on me to retire from all public and
obligatory duty, and to do no more than what my strength or
spirits would enable me occasionally and privately to attend
to.&nbsp; With this intention, after inspecting numerous places,
we made a purchase in the salubrious and delightful district of
Niagara, and were just on the point of removing thither; but, on
inspection, the title did not appear satisfactory, and, at the
suggestion of the solicitor, I did not complete the
purchase.&nbsp; While, however, this matter was pending, my
people, at a public meeting, strongly expressed their hope, that
I would not adhere to my intentions of removal, and so
unanimously and affectionately pressed my continuance among them,
that I at length consented; and have since made arrangements for
building a house at my own expense, on some land I had previously
purchased near the church, and am intending now to go on with as
much prudence as I can; but still to go on, and to die, if it
please God, in the harness.&nbsp; Of late, however, the Lord has
been pleased so to enable me to use appropriate exercise in the
open air, and so to husband my little strength, that all the <a
name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
221</span>unfavourable symptoms under which I was labouring some
few months ago, have altogether disappeared; and with present
adequacy of physical powers and with more than usual
encouragement in spirit, I am proceeding with my work, and trust
all will be well.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>After speaking of his family, he adds,</p>
<p>* * * * * Much have we, indeed, of God&rsquo;s temporal smile,
nor is the light of his gracious countenance withheld.&nbsp; All,
all is love, and we would not only submissively, but gratefully
adore.&nbsp; Permit me to assure you of our best wishes for the
months or years, which may yet be in reserve, may they prove
pre-eminently the best!&nbsp; &ldquo;For such power belongeth
unto God;&rdquo; and believe me, Yours, my dear Madam, very
sincerely,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">G. <span
class="smcap">Mortimer</span>.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Mr. Mortimer left England in part to avoid the storms and
tempests which overhung that country, little thinking that in
attempting to avoid a <i>possible</i> danger, he ran into an
<i>actual</i> one; so very dim is our foresight and so weak our
power of resistance.&nbsp; A destructive rebellion took place in
Canada in 1837, which, from his residence being on one of the
main roads to Toronto, whither the rioters were proceeding, put
even the personal safety of his family in great jeopardy.&nbsp;
He refers especially to this event in the following
letter:&mdash;</p>
<h3>TO MRS. HOLLAND.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Thornhill, April 3, 1838.</p>
<p>You kindly allude to the circumstance of apparent danger in
which we have been placed during our recent revolt, but God has
been very merciful to us, <a name="page222"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 222</span>and, not merely screened us under
the sheltering wing of his good providence, but graciously kept
our minds in sweet serenity and peace.&nbsp; You may judge of the
apparent peril to which we were exposed, when I tell you, that on
the afternoon of the evening on which they (the rebels) proceeded
to Toronto, two parties passed our door, the one consisting of
200, and the other of 300 persons; and were, under God&rsquo;s
providence, kept from the execution of their murderous and
destructive designs against the persons and houses of the more
loyal and opulent, merely in consequence of their being obliged
to hurry past us to Toronto two or three days sooner than they
had anticipated.&nbsp; As a clergyman too, and more especially as
a beneficed one, noted and vilified as possessing one of the
obnoxious rectories, concerning which they have so loudly
clamoured; on this account I was a doubly marked man; my name was
inserted in their list of intended arsons, and my family as well
as myself were to be shot, as we were attempting to escape the
flames; at least, such were the pleasing tidings which were
widely circulated among us, and the fearful and timid found it no
easy matter to restrain their feelings, or to exhibit calmness of
spirit, or manliness of conduct.&nbsp; Many passed sleepless
nights, and all around us gave indication that there were solid
and extensive grounds for alarm.&nbsp; Colonel M&mdash;, the
person who was shot on the first night of the revolt, was an
attendant on our church and a resident in our neighbourhood, and,
in the very midst of the excitement, was brought to our
churchyard for interment.&nbsp; A hostile attack was expected by
many, and the mob, who assembled to pay the last sad offices to
their veteran friend and neighbour, came accoutred in their
swords, daggers, pistols and fowling pieces.&nbsp; A novel and a
painful scene, but which was altogether uncalled for; no attempt
having been contemplated.&nbsp; My eye glanced on one of the
assembly; <a name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
223</span>a loyal, but strange and penurious man, whose habits
had never suffered him to become possessed of anything in the
shape of arms, and he was leaning on his trusty lengthened pitch
fork, a weapon, of which I heard, he was afterwards vaunting that
there was nothing like that.&nbsp; His presence, however, to my
mind at least, was far from pleasing; it ill-accorded with the
scene before us, and seemed so ridiculous, that I could hardly
refrain from a momentary smile.&nbsp; Of the general and more
public details you are doubtless most fully apprized; for I
perceive that our Canadian affairs are exciting a peculiar
interest in our fatherland, and are commented on with an
accuracy, which shows that they must have been perused with every
means of the fullest information lying before them.&nbsp; All is
now, through God&rsquo;s providence, in a state of quietness;
while, therefore, we feel indebted to our friends for their kind
sympathy, and their affectionate expressions of hope, that our
provincial troubles may cause us either quickly, or eventually to
retrace our steps towards our beloved native land, we must still
assure them that nothing is further from our thoughts; our path
has been deliberately chosen, our objects have been extensively
gained, much of God&rsquo;s temporal smile is resting upon us, we
are now established in our ample, commodious, and, I might say,
beautiful house, the society around us is superior to what is
found in most country places in England; our income is ample and
enough for all exigencies.&nbsp; Life is gliding gently along
with as little disquietude and as much comfort as we can ever
expect to find in the present world; peace and tranquillity reign
in our domestic circle, God&rsquo;s spiritual blessings are
experienced by the majority of our family, and some hopeful
indications given by all, and, therefore, why should we wish for
a change?&nbsp; Of myself and my own immediate duties, I would
say, but little good is being done.&nbsp; Ministers are <a
name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 224</span>much
wanted, and, were I in England, it would be only to extrude and
thrust out some of the partially engaged or wholly unoccupied
with which you are overburdened already.&nbsp; No, my endeared
sister, much as we love our native land, much as we value our
still more beloved friends, we ought not to close our eyes on our
present mercies, or so mix up the cherishing of regret with
causes for thanksgiving, as to destroy their efficacy, or to
diminish their heart-stirring effect.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>While Mr. Mortimer&rsquo;s friends did not approve of his
expatriating himself and family, so some of them, who visited him
in Canada, were by no means convinced of his having improved on
his lot and position in life by his change of country.&nbsp; The
Rev. B. Luckock was one of these, who was so struck with the
inferiority of everything which he saw, that he afterwards wrote
to him in no very measured terms of his dislike and almost
detestation of what he called his wretched situation.&nbsp; These
condoling and sympathizing notes produced no echo in the mind of
Mr. Mortimer, and he wrote to his friend in the following playful
terms, united to strains of piety and seriousness, very
expressive of his own satisfaction with the change which he had
made:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Both your letters found me at Thornhill,
and from the same miserable and deserted place, I date, as you
will perceive, my present letter.&nbsp; It is difficult to
determine what class of feelings we should indulge in at the
accumulated epithets of loathing and abhorrence with which you
speak of our delightfully happy sojourn; our disposition,
however, to merriment prevailed, and we all laughed most heartily
at your intemperate and ill-timed abusings, so completely and so
pleasantly had the whole class of our own feelings and
circumstances been changed since your visit to that anything but
&ldquo;happy valley.&rdquo;&nbsp; I <a name="page225"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 225</span>need not detail to you the various
incidents which, through the kind providence of our God, have
tended both to fix our steps and to settle our minds; the
hundreds of miles which were previously travelled&mdash;the
ineligibility of every spot and every abode in some important
particular&mdash;the striking Providence which put some
unexpected and final stop to our negotiations in each of the
matters on which we were disposed to venture&mdash;the altered
feeling and conduct discovered by my people, when they perceived
me fully resolved to leave&mdash;their solicitations, accompanied
with proffered, though not accepted, pecuniary liberality to
remain among them&mdash;the erection of a large, commodious, and
tasty, not to say beautiful, house, on the few acres of my own,
near the church, which I had some time before purchased&mdash;the
settling of a most esteemed, and delightful, intelligent,
well-educated, Christian family, within a few stones&rsquo; throw
of our residence&mdash;and, finally, the induction and installing
of the long unbeneficed curate into that most lucrative and
honourable piece of preferment, &ldquo;the Rectory of
Thornhill.&rdquo;&nbsp; Happy consummation of the most ambitious
wishes, or only to be credited by the envied and enviable
dignitaries of our Church, of which &ldquo;I am proud to
think&rdquo; that my valued and respected friend is one!&nbsp;
But I wander; there, then, we are at Thornhill; but, through
God&rsquo;s mercy, under circumstances of great comfort, much,
very much, indeed, which calls forth our gratitude and praise; so
that what I partly smilingly, partly ironically, and partly
believingly, predicted, has been strongly fulfilled; the course
adopted by the Abyssinian Prince has been closely followed by
ourselves, and not an atom of wish do we now feel to exchange the
place of our abode for any other in the province, and we may say
even in the world.&nbsp; Of the younger branches of the family, I
am not of course speaking; they may possibly be far from the rest
and quiet, a <a name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
226</span>and satisfaction of the older folk.&nbsp; As to
ourselves, however, we wish for no change; to live and to die
where God&rsquo;s good providence has now at length fixed us is
the ultimatum of all our wishes.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>TO THE REV. JOHN ARMSTRONG.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Thornhill, Upper Canada,<br />
Feb. 11, 1840.</p>
<p>My dear Armstrong,</p>
<p>I <span class="smcap">feel</span> much indebted to you for
having complied with Mr. Ditcher&rsquo;s suggestion, as well as
to Mr. D. himself, for so kindly and judiciously making it. <a
name="citation226"></a><a href="#footnote226"
class="citation">[226]</a>&nbsp; And I hope that now we shall be
able to enjoy a little occasional intercourse, not perhaps to the
same extent, or with the same buoyant energetic feelings of our
more youthful bygone days, but with the spirit of those who are
drawing nearer and nearer to life&rsquo;s peaceful termination,
and who, while grateful for the attached intercourse which has
characterised a few of their past years, must still feel that in
this world of severings and perturbations we form our several
friendships, not so much to enjoy them on earth, as to renew and
perfect them in heaven.</p>
<p>What you mention concerning your dear family has greatly
interested me.&nbsp; God has been very very gracious to you and
them, and I do sincerely praise him on your and their behalf.</p>
<p>I have thought a good deal on the hints you throw out
respecting my namesake and endeared <a name="page227"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 227</span>godson, and hope the best wishes of
your heart will be realised with regard to him.&nbsp; Canada,
however, does not strike me as being the place for him, at least
in a pecuniary point of view.&nbsp; &pound;150 sterling, with a
house, and three or four acres of land, is the utmost he should
calculate on.&nbsp; Though a rector, I have no more than
&pound;135 sterling, and have no parsonage house, but am dwelling
in one erected by myself, at my own cost.&nbsp; The general
allowance made by the bishop at present is &pound;100 sterling;
and this is paid out of the sum contributed by the different
societies in England, principally the Propagation, or by the fund
arising from the sale of clergy reserves.&nbsp; In addition,
however, to this &pound;100, the bishop expects that the
congregation should provide four acres of land, build a
parsonage, and pledge themselves to give a salary of
&pound;50.&nbsp; But this pledge is too frequently merely
nominal, the money being very seldom fully, or at all nearly,
paid, and little more is obtained beyond the bishop&rsquo;s
allowance, excepting what may arise from surplice fees and the
rental of church pews.&nbsp; Something in addition, however, may
be expected when the vexatious matter of the clergy reserves
shall be settled; but as these will be uncleared land, no
immediate advantage to any extent would of course accrue.&nbsp;
Upper Canada, indeed, I consider as one of the most necessitous
of all our provinces, and none offer so little in the shape of
just and equitable remuneration.&nbsp; Much, therefore, as I
should rejoice on many accounts at Mr. George&rsquo;s coming
here, I am afraid he would find it very difficult to procure the
means of adequate support.&nbsp; Orders, indeed, if only
tolerably qualified, he might with ease and without expense
obtain.&nbsp; Important spheres, also, of ministerial engagement
are numerously presented.&nbsp; And to one who has no thought of
entering on a married life, or is prepared to rough it, or
contentedly to sink below the customary grade <a
name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 228</span>of his
profession&mdash;to one so prepared, the missionary field of
Canada is the very place.&nbsp; But to those who are otherwise
minded, we ought, in Christian charity, and even in common
fairness, to present the salutary <i>cave</i>.&nbsp; Sir George
Arthur, no doubt, would do all in his power to assist him, should
we be permitted to retain him among us; but in Canada his means
of this description are exceedingly limited, and I should almost
think that he could exert a more beneficial influence on his
behalf by endeavouring to obtain, through his English friends,
some appointment as chaplain to one of the colonies, or, should
this be questionable, some benefice in Australia, or elsewhere,
under circumstances of more encouragement than we are authorized
to hold out in our poor, neglected, harassed province.</p>
<p>You speak of the possibility of giving us a visit; I need
scarcely assure you how greatly it would delight us all; I fear,
however, that Sir George will have left us, unless you are
somewhat agile in your movements.&nbsp; I have been apprised by
him (though quite confidentially) of his kind intentions towards
yourself.&nbsp; How astonished should I have been at their
realization, and how unspeakably rejoiced.&nbsp; But still all is
well; and if time discover not this, faith can tell us of an
important day that will.</p>
<p>You lay on me, my endeared friend, a next to impossible
injunction; what a string of kind affectionate inquiries relative
to my own procedures, personally, parochially, domestically.</p>
<p>My labours, I trust, are not altogether in vain in the Lord;
our congregation has been increasing ever since I came here, and
this year the church was enlarged to nearly double its former
size, and the additional pews were all let in three or four days
after they were offered for rental.&nbsp; Some few of my people
seem to have been under gracious influence, and have given me
much of encouragement and <a name="page229"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 229</span>hope.&nbsp; And my people at large
show me much kindness, and appear attached to my
ministrations.</p>
<p>Socially and domestically we have much of comfort.&nbsp; Good
house and premises, good servants, one of whom has been with us
twenty-three years&mdash;and good neighbourhood&mdash;pleasant
distance (twelve or thirteen miles) from Toronto&mdash;almost
every English comfort within our reach, not to say every
luxury.&nbsp; The only cause of regret, perhaps, is that in these
matters we are going too much a-head.</p>
<p>We are far too gay, as a neighbourhood, for my simple
liking.&nbsp; A few evenings since, one gentleman had a party of
sixty persons present, many more invited, with a part of the band
of the 93rd regiment, from Toronto.&nbsp; And very shortly after,
another of my congregation had a still gayer and more extensive
assemblage.&nbsp; But you will now begin to sigh over my
interminable and undecipherable scrawl; and therefore, in simple
pity to your straining eyes, I shall only add, that with most
affectionate and Christian regards, in which my whole family
unite, to yourself and dear Mrs. A.,</p>
<p style="text-align: center">I remain,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Your ever attached, though unworthy
friend,<br />
<span class="smcap">George Mortimer</span>.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I insert the following address, not only because it may be
generally useful, but because it may be as applicable now to
those for whose use it was originally written, as at the time of
its publication: and if a stranger may be allowed to urge their
attention afresh to the warm and affectionate remonstrance of
their late pastor, he would just remind them, that Divine
worship, on the Lord&rsquo;s day, being a paramount duty, an
attendance upon both services is obligatory on all sincere
Christians, except duties of mercy or necessity preclude such
attendance.&nbsp; All <a name="page230"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 230</span>other excuses or reasons admit of no
justification, and in the great day will be viewed only in the
light of positive neglect of God&rsquo;s service, arising either
from sinful disobedience, or culpable indifference.&nbsp; The
partially formal observance of the Lord&rsquo;s Day, by an
attendance on the morning service, spending the rest of the day
in pursuits entirely alien from sacred duties, is the Sabbath of
the mere nominal Christian, not of the sincere disciple of
Christ.</p>
<h3>ADDRESS<br />
<span class="GutSmall">TO THE INHABITANTS OF THE TOWNSHIP OF
THORNHILL</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Thornhill, Oct. 1, 1840.</p>
<p>My much-endeared Parishioners,</p>
<p>I <span class="smcap">persuade</span> myself you will receive
with your wonted kindness a few words which I am desirous of
pressing on your serious attention.</p>
<p>Our church, I am happy to think, has, through your own
liberality and the kind assistance of our English friends, been
so far enlarged as to admit of considerable increase in the
attendance; and it affords me matter of much satisfaction, that
even before its completion, the whole of the extra-sittings were
secured.&nbsp; And though occasionally pained at the irregular
attendance of some, still I cannot but feel gratified in meeting,
on the Sabbath mornings, so encouraging a congregation as that
which usually attends.</p>
<p>But here I am sorry to say that much of my satisfaction, as
connected with our church attendance, terminates.&nbsp; For when
the morning service is concluded, as though the Sabbath itself
were also ended, we see no more of the mass of our congregation
till we meet them on the following Sunday.&nbsp; A painful <a
name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 231</span>inquiry,
then, as you will easily conceive, is often presented to our
minds, as to the probable manner in which the remaining hours of
your Sabbath are employed.&nbsp; Some few of you, I know, are
kindly endeavouring to instruct the young in our Sunday-schools;
some few also (oh that there were more!) make a point of
instructing their own families at home; and some few more attend
the evening service in the church.&nbsp; But what, I would
affectionately inquire, becomes of our congregation at large,
after the morning service?&nbsp; As consistent churchmen, I take
for granted that you conscientiously confine yourselves to the
ministrations of the church: for, convinced that the principles
of dissenters are in direct opposition to&mdash;are altogether
subversive of&mdash;the interests, if not the very existence of
the church, you cannot but abstain from everything which may seem
in any degree to support them; and as your attendance on their
place of worship must be so considered, I may naturally conclude
that you refrain from frequenting them.&nbsp; But as you go to no
dissenting place of worship, and as only a very small number
attend the evening service in the church, in what way must I
suppose that the rest of the Sabbath is, for the most part,
employed?&nbsp; Oh, think not that I am uncharitable, if I cannot
help suspecting that it is too frequently frittered away in
idleness, or in unprofitable pursuits; in unhallowed reading; in
domestic amusements; in visiting or receiving visits; in Sabbath
rambles; or possibly in some other still more decided
profanations of this sacred day.</p>
<p>Under this impression, then, you will permit me to urge upon
you the bounden duty of increased conscientiousness in regard to
Sabbath-employments?&nbsp; Let the golden moments be duly
appreciated and diligently improved.&nbsp; Religious reading,
family instruction, and personal devotions, should, of course, <a
name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 232</span>employ a
portion of your time, especially your Sunday afternoons; but as
to your Sabbath evenings, I should hope that you will be
convinced of the paramount obligation, to devote these to an
attendance on the second service, which is now regularly afforded
to you in the church: and that you will strive also so to arrange
your other matters, as to admit of your being accompanied by as
many as possible of your respective households.</p>
<p>I ought not, perhaps, to withhold from you, that much surprise
has frequently been expressed by my clerical and other friends,
that I should not as yet have succeeded in obtaining a more
regular attendance on the second service, which, at so many
different times, I had been attempting to establish: and our
excellent bishop was much at a loss to account for the painful
circumstance.&nbsp; I am hoping, however, that this reproach will
ere long, by the Divine blessing, be removed from among us.&nbsp;
Public opinion is now so universally in favour of having a second
service in our churches, whenever the clergy have it in their
power to give one, that I have no need to enter upon this
point.&nbsp; But surely if it be admitted that it is the duty of
the clergy to provide such a service, is it not equally a duty on
the part of the people to attend it when it shall be provided for
them?</p>
<p>Suffer me, then, to request your kind and willing co-operation
in this matter, calculated, as it so evidently is, to promote the
spiritual good of yourselves and of the neighbourhood at
large.&nbsp; And will you permit me to tell you how repeatedly my
heart has sunk within me, when I have adverted to the little I
have hitherto been able to effect in this matter?&nbsp; How
grieved have I been to look around our church on the Sabbath
evening, and to see so many seats vacated, which in the morning
had been so cheeringly filled.&nbsp; Oh how difficult do I then
find it to believe <a name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
233</span>that such absentees can feel much of affection either
towards myself or my assistant&mdash;their church or their
Saviour.&nbsp; But I try to check these feelings, and would hope
for better things.&nbsp; I well know the kindness of your hearts,
for many a proof have I received of your affectionate
regards.&nbsp; And I trust you will not only bear with me in this
expostulation and appeal, but so co-operate with me, that in my
next report to our respected bishop, I may be able to convey the
gratifying intelligence, that the attendance on the evening
service is little short of that, which, with such pleasure, we so
generally meet with on the Sabbath morning.</p>
<p>Believe me,</p>
<p style="text-align: center">My much endeared friends and
parishioners,</p>

<h3>TO HIS SISTER, MRS. HOLLAND.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Thornhill, Oct. 21, 1840.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * * * * *</p>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> congratulate you on dear
Henry&rsquo;s account.&nbsp; Oh, how glad should we have been had
Canada been commiserated by him: had I twenty sons and should you
ask, how I should wish to dispose of them, I would say, Oh, let
them be clergymen&mdash;pious, faithful, useful ministers of our
beloved Church, and let them all be fixed in Canada.&nbsp; I hope
my dear nephew will be on his guard: caution him against a
religion of forms and ceremonies, and high priestly assumption,
none of which can be maintained without sapping the grand
fundamental article of our Protestant religion, <span
class="smcap">Justification by Faith</span>.&nbsp; Once admit
that there is anything inherently gracious in anything but what
is simple faith, and Protestantism <a name="page234"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 234</span>is virtually at an end: let anything
be expected otherwise than from Christ by faith through the power
and agency of the divine Spirit, and carry out this admission to
its full length, and you are inevitably landed safely in
Romanism.&nbsp; I fear much for the younger clergy.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>In another letter, in reference to the above subject, he
writes:&mdash;</p>
<p>Oh, my dear sister, I quite tremble when I think of the
probable results of the present wide spread of tractarian
notions.&nbsp; High churchism, if it be suffered to proceed, and
does not meet with a speedy and most effectual check from the
rulers of our Church, will hurry hundreds and thousands into
Romanism, or force the decidedly Evangelical into
secession.&nbsp; Awful times seem to be awaiting us, and I hardly
dare think of them: indeed, I keep putting away every
consideration almost as fast as it comes; or, rather, I endeavour
to keep rolling the weighty care upon One who is both able and
pledged, in answer to believing prayer, to sustain it.&nbsp;
These principles are exerting no small degree of influence in our
province.&nbsp; Oh, forget us not in your prayers! we greatly
need them.&nbsp; As to myself I need say but little.&nbsp; My
health and spirits are restored to a degree which I little
anticipated, and I am enabled to go through such duties as I
engage in with comparative ease and comfort.&nbsp; A calm,
tranquil, peaceful old age has been mercifully vouchsafed me, and
all I want is more grace to enjoy and improve my many
mercies.&nbsp; I am always backward to speak of spiritual things,
lest while recounting God&rsquo;s mercies, &ldquo;self-applause
should step in;&rdquo; but I still owe it to the goodness of my
condescending God and Saviour to testify that I do hope his work
is not retrograding in my soul.&nbsp; Infirmities, I have
many&mdash;mental and spiritual, as well as bodily; but still
some <a name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
235</span>precious deepenings are I hope not fallaciously
discernible.</p>
<h3>TO THE REV. JOHN COOPER.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Thornhill, near Toronto, Upper
Canada,<br />
Jan. 4, 1841.</p>
<p>My much endeared Friend,</p>
<p>How can I convey to you the heartfelt satisfaction, which I
received in perusing your most truly welcome letter?&nbsp; My
many infirmities will <i>hardly</i> admit of my complying with
your request of an early reply; for I have only written one
letter, I believe, for many months past, and that with extreme
difficulty; and I have no expectation of being able to finish
this without sundry rests and postponements.&nbsp; But I am
desirous of making the attempt, and indeed should feel myself
altogether unworthy of so endeared and estimable a friend were I
to place <i>his</i> letter among my unanswered accumulations, or
avail myself of the filial aid of one of the amanuenses to whom,
on especial occasions, I am constrained to have recourse.</p>
<p>But while I allude to the circumstance of difficulty connected
with writing, I ought not, I suppose, to pass on to other
matters, without a few words of explanation.&nbsp; About a year
and half ago, I suffered sundry strains and contusions from a
fall, from which I have never yet quite recovered; and though I
feel no positive pain, when I am perfectly at rest, yet when I
use my shoulder or the muscles connected with it, in any
continuous operation, I am sure to suffer; and, whenever I
imprudently and pertinaciously persist, I feel the effects for
days, weeks, and even months.&nbsp; A habit of caution therefore,
has crept upon me; and having at no time possessed any <a
name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 236</span>strong
predilections for the labours of the pen, and especially for the
duties of the correspondent, I have, at length, almost persuaded
myself, that I am fully released from the obligation.</p>
<p>I am reluctant to fill my sheet with reference to myself, and
yet I ought not to withhold from you the yet further allusion to
infirmities.&nbsp; Long have I been failing in my health, and
long have my ministerial duties proved too great a call on my
general strength, and especially my nervous system; but I still
feel reluctant to retire from them.&nbsp; My wife and children
were indeed repeatedly striving to bring me to the point, and
represented to me the desirableness of withdrawing before such an
attack should be experienced, as would render the residue of life
burdensome to myself, distressing to my friends, and useless to
all.&nbsp; Still, I shrunk,&mdash;it seemed almost an awful thing
to retire from duties so solemnly undertaken; and from which none
but God could release me.&nbsp; In this state of uncertainty I
was seized with so violent a nervous affection, while engaged in
some public but unimportant matter, that I lost, in the course of
few minutes, all power to read, and could not for some days make
out the very commonest words without spelling them just like a
child; and though, as my nerves acquired a little more tone, I
was enabled to recover somewhat of my suspended powers, it was
not till several weeks after my seizure, that I was enabled to
appear again in public duties; and then I could merely
<i>preach</i>, not <i>read</i>.&nbsp; But this resumption of my
duties gradually brought on such oppressive, not to say alarming,
symptoms, that I, at length, felt fully convinced that my poor
weakly frame was no longer able to bear such onerous duties; and
having, through God&rsquo;s mercy, obtained an assistant, who
exactly suits both myself and people, I have turned over to him
my yearly stipend with every public and oppressive duty, and am
now rector <a name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
237</span>indeed in name, but little further: I visit, indeed,
parochially, and am endeavouring in various little ways, to
counsel, regulate, and forward the movements of others, and to be
a bond of union to the somewhat heterogeneous mass around us; and
the silent intercessor for their diversified good, when it is not
in my power in any other way to aid them.&nbsp; And I trust, that
God is still among us as a people.&nbsp; As to other things, the
kind interest which you have ever taken in my welfare, makes me
wish that you would just introduce yourself, if only for a few
minutes, into our midst.&nbsp; I could not have believed that so
much comfort awaited me in my latter days.&nbsp; Pecuniary means
quite adequate, not only for necessaries, but for extensive
comforts; a commodious, elegant, and tasty abode, close and open
carriage for summer, a cutter and sleigh for winter &amp;c.;
estimable society, and superior by far to most neighbourhoods in
the province, within two hours&rsquo; easy drive of the capital
(Toronto), and this well and even luxuriously supplied.&nbsp; No
lack of literature.&nbsp; I see the best books, and have access
to, or take in myself, the most approved periodicals and
newspapers, almost to overpowering.&nbsp; And all this, when I
derive no income from my ministry (excepting the pittance from
letting the glebe of my rectory), and having no aid, as in
England, from pupilizing; so great are the advantages of residing
in this fine province.&nbsp; In England all was struggling and
difficulty, and no possibility of settling my family; while here,
I am enabled to call every reasonable comfort around me, and to
live in a style, not indeed of ostentation and display, which has
never been my aim, but of comparative ease and comfort, such as
calls for many an expression of grateful praise.&nbsp; The
earlier part of my residence and ministrations in this place were
not indeed over abundant in encouragement, and I had frequent
thoughts of relinquishing my apparently <a
name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 238</span>hopeless
charge, and escaping from my comfortless location.&nbsp; But my
way never appeared to me so satisfactorily opened as to authorize
the final step, and truly thankful am I that I continued.&nbsp;
For three or four years past all has been encouraging, and I
cannot but regard the spot in which I hope now to end my days, as
one of the most eligible and pleasant, which this fine country
can present.&nbsp; The visit paid to us by Mr. B. L&mdash;, and
to which you allude in your letter, was in the very midst of our
discouragements, and most affectionately did he sympathize with
us.&nbsp; A few months after his return he expressed similar
sympathy in the letter he wrote to me, which quite made me smile,
as descriptive of scenes and feelings which seemed to have
reference to &ldquo;the lang syne;&rdquo; so completely had our
circumstances amended.&nbsp; But when, in a subsequent letter of
a few months later date, his mind seemed only able to dwell on
the same mournful scenes, and we had got fully established in our
comfortable abode, with all our numerous satisfactions around us,
and at the same time enjoying abundant proofs of our being deeply
and firmly seated in the affections of our attached people.&nbsp;
Thus circumstanced . . .</p>
<p style="text-align: right">March 25, 1841.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thus</span> far, my endeared friend, had I
written nearly three months ago, and then abruptly terminated my
operose endeavour, effected at four different sittings, and at
length laid by, almost in despair.&nbsp; But through God&rsquo;s
mercy, I am beginning again to use my pen with far less of
annoyance; and, after having despatched three short letters, on
the three last days, and being tolerably sound after the
operation, I have looked out my suspended communication, and have
no small pleasure in resuming.</p>
<p><a name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 239</span>The
non-completed sentence will, I suppose, speak for itself, the
intention being simply to assure you that, though possibly you
may have heard through Mr. B. L&mdash;, of our being surrounded
by nothing but <i>desagr&eacute;mens</i>, we are, in fact, some
of the most delightfully located persons in the
province&mdash;perfect joy and satisfaction&mdash;a paradisaical
blessedness&mdash;a very elysium of delight.&nbsp; Unfortunately,
however, for my description, it was written in January instead of
March,&mdash;the provinces since united&mdash;seat of government
removed&mdash;radical elections&mdash;a fearful preponderance of
rebel abettors&mdash;destructives and liberals&mdash;our beloved
Church threatened&mdash;the Papacy fearlessly exhibited, and
giving but too much reason for anticipating its eventual triumph,
and Protestant Episcopal subversion.&nbsp; All around us gloomy,
and full of dismal forebodings; and our only hope (if the Divine
Disposer be overlooked) in the detrusion from office of those
Whigs, who so vexatiously retain their places at home, and not
content with liberalism, and bringing into jeopardy
England&rsquo;s every good, are carrying with a yet higher hand
their destructive and church-subversive measures in its
colonies.&nbsp; Such, alas! is the present aspect of our
horizon!&nbsp; But as to myself, I am happy to say that it does
not much trouble me.&nbsp; It is indeed not a little cloud which
hangs over us, but dark and far-spreading; and yet I cherish hope
that it will soon blow over.&nbsp; We have had our direful
threatenings before, but God has dealt very mercifully with us;
and I trust that similar mercies are now also in reserve.</p>
<p>But I am hardly leaving myself room to say a few words on
other matters.&nbsp; Greatly did it rejoice me, my endeared
friend, to follow you in your most pleasing recital of the
numerous exhibitions of God&rsquo;s mercy and faithfulness to
yourself and family, and I have no question but that in many
respects you will see yet greater things than these;&mdash;yes!
all is well&mdash;<a name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
240</span>much of spiritual good has been reaped by my beloved
friend.&nbsp; He has gone forth bearing precious seed, and even
here has come again with joy, bringing his sheaves with him.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">April 21, 1841.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Much</span> to my mortification, I was
unable, as I had wished, to finish my letter, when I added the
few lines about a month ago; but that slight effort brought on a
return of my disability, and obliged me to be again quiet; and,
were I to consult the suggestions of prudence, I should not, I
believe, now venture on a few lines which I am desirous of
appending by way of conclusion.&nbsp; But I am so thoroughly
ashamed of both my apparent neglect, and the fussiness attendant
on my endeavours to write to you the letter I have done, that I
can keep my sheet by me no longer, and, though I seem to have
many things to say to you, I must content myself with the
assurance, that with unabated affection, and with every good wish
for yourself, Mrs. C&mdash;, and family, in which Mrs. M&mdash;
most sincerely unites, I have the pleasure to subscribe
myself,</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Your long attached Friend</p>
<p style="text-align: right">And brother in the gospel,<br />
<span class="smcap">George Mortimer</span>.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>After an interval of eighteen years, I saw my late beloved
friend only for the second time after our leaving Cambridge and
settling in life.&nbsp; I saw him for a few short hours in the
year 1824, and, from that time, I had not that pleasure again
until July, 1842, when I had the long-desired happiness of paying
him a visit at Thornhill, and passing a week with him, in the
society of his kind family, to whom <a name="page241"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 241</span>I had never before been personally
introduced.&nbsp; We used, when at college, to promise ourselves
the pleasure of alternate annual visits, little thinking that,
for so long a period, the bounds of our habitation were to be no
nearer together than the eastern and western hemisphere.&nbsp; At
Thornhill, I saw my endeared friend in different circumstances
and relations to what I had ever personally known him
before&mdash;as the pastor, the husband, and the father; and I
was not disappointed in contemplating him in these
characters.&nbsp; He was as venerable in appearance as
grey&mdash;I might rather say white&mdash;hairs could make him,
and which crowned a countenance of the most benignant
aspect&mdash;serene, intelligent, animated, and beaming with
tenderness and affection.&nbsp; There was also in his manners, in
the tones of his voice, and, when speaking, in the peculiar
expressiveness of his countenance, something remarkably sweet,
mild, and engaging.&nbsp; The general contour of the upper part
of his body, especially his long white hair behind, reminded me
of the later likenesses of the justly celebrated John
Wesley.&nbsp; His body was of low stature and deformed, which, at
first sight, might have given to a stranger but a lowly opinion
of him; but every disadvantage from appearance soon wore off, and
the mind shone brightly through the mean and weak and
uncommanding body, which contained it.&nbsp; A pleasing instance
of this effect occurred when I was in Canada.&nbsp; He was kind
enough to spend three or four days with me at my
son&rsquo;s&mdash;a visit to which the following letter has some
reference, and which, as being the last I ever received from him,
though it contain nothing of any importance, I insert with a deep
recollection of the intercourse which I had with my friend on the
occasion.&nbsp; We were spending an evening together at the house
of a friend: a lady of piety and intelligence was present as a
visitor like ourselves, and who had never before seen <a
name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 242</span>Mr.
Mortimer.&nbsp; Before the evening passed, she observed to me,
&ldquo;That gentleman is no common man,&rdquo; so struck was she,
and, perhaps, contrary to her expectations, with the superior
cast of his conversation, which I had myself also observed in the
course of the evening.</p>
<h3>TO THE REV. JOHN ARMSTRONG.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Thornhill, Aug. 7, 1842.</p>
<p>My dear Armstrong,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> struck me that the last thing
you said to me in parting was, that you would inform me of your
movements, and for such information I have hitherto been waiting;
but as I possibly may have misunderstood you, and you are
expecting to hear from me, I had better write at once.</p>
<p>Circumstances, I find, will not admit of my going to New York
just at present, nor do I apprehend that I shall find it
necessary for the accomplishment of my literary purpose to go
beyond Buffalo, or Rochester at the farthest, though this I
cannot quite settle till I see you.</p>
<p>I shall hope, if all be well, to sleep in Toronto on Monday
next, and proceed the next morning for Niagara or Queenston; or,
in fact, whatever place I shall find, on inquiry on board the
steamer <i>Transit</i>, shall be the nearest point to your
son&rsquo;s abode; and from that point shall make my way to him
as I can.&nbsp; I am no nice traveller on such occasions, and
therefore very readily get accommodated.</p>
<p>There are two or three matters I am wishing to talk over with
you, and which strike me as of no small importance in reference
to our Canadian ecclesiastical matters.&nbsp; I suppose you have
not been able to arrive at any decision in our favour; and, while
we <a name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 243</span>are
beating our rough and perilous way, you will be felicitating
yourself, when in some tranquil cozy retreat, that you have
escaped the threatening danger of our more unquiet seas.&nbsp;
But whether such outward tranquillity is awaiting my endeared
friend or not, I trust he will ever experience much of that peace
which his peace-imparting Saviour can alone bestow; and may the
peace and rest which awaits him in heaven be realized by him in
all its delightful fulness.&nbsp; And oh, may his unworthy friend
be privileged to meet him there!&nbsp; Our kindest regards to
yourself and our endeared young friend,</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Yours ever, my dear Armstrong,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Most affectionately and
sincerely,<br />
<span class="smcap">George Mortimer</span>.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The last letter addressed to his fondly attached sister, Mrs.
Holland, was written in a broken manner, and was probably among
the last, except on mere matters of business, which he ever
wrote.&nbsp; I have myself seen but one other written after the
date which this bears, and which will be noticed presently.</p>
<h3>TO HIS SISTER.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Thornhill, April 6, 1844.</p>

more than compensated.&nbsp; May that blessed Christian grace of

something.&nbsp; Kindest love from all to all.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The day before his death, Mr. Mortimer addressed a long letter
to his brother, the Rev. Thomas Mortimer, full of interest and
full of kindness, and which, no doubt, will be treasured up by
him with great care and affection; but it is of so personal and
domestic a tenor, that it is only a single short extract that I
can with propriety insert in this memoir, though nothing could be
more appropriate, as a conclusion to his correspondence.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">June 14, 1844.</p>
<p>* * * * Of myself a word or two will suffice.&nbsp; Though old
and grey-headed, my God forsakes me not; but graciously imparts a
gleam of sunshine in my latter days, which almost makes me
marvel.&nbsp; I have just completed my sixtieth year, <a
name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 245</span>and, though
encompassed, as ever, with infirmities, have for the last
twelvemonth done full duty twice on the Sabbath.</p>
<p>The flame yet flickers, and till it shall sink into total
darkness, may it send forth some shining ray to enlighten the
minds and change the hearts of my beloved Canadian people.</p>

<p>Mr. Mortimer&rsquo;s death, which took place on Saturday, June
15, 1844, has been so suitably and feelingly described by others
that I have nothing to do but to avail myself of their
services.&nbsp; These consist of notices of the event, taken by
the public papers of Toronto; a resolution of the Central Board
of the Church Society of the Diocese of Toronto, presented to
Mrs. Mortimer by the Rev. W. W. Ripley, secretary; a brief memoir
drawn up by the Rev. Thomas Grinfield, and inserted in the
<i>Bristol Journal</i>; and letters written by his amiable and
excellent daughter, Miss Phebe Mortimer, giving some account of
the last years of her father&rsquo;s life, as well as of the
circumstances and particulars of his death.</p>
<h3>(<i>From the</i> &ldquo;<i>Church</i>&rdquo; <i>newspaper of
June</i> 21, 1844.)</h3>
<p>It is with feelings of no ordinary pain and grief that we
announce the sudden and afflictive death of a venerable friend
and fellow-labourer in this diocese, the Rev. George Mortimer,
M.A., Rector of Thornhill.</p>
<p>As this deeply-lamented gentleman was proceeding <a
name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 246</span>on Saturday
afternoon last from his residence to Toronto, his horse, when
about half way through the village, took fright, and the reins
breaking, the carriage was upset, and Mr. Mortimer was thrown
violently against the stump of a tree.&nbsp; He received
immediate assistance, and was carried into the house of a
neighbour, Mr. Griffiths.&nbsp; Dr. Paget, his medical attendant,
speedily arrived, and drove him home.&nbsp; On the way he spoke
with cheerfulness, and hopes were entertained that the injury
would not prove very serious; but soon after his arrival at his
own house, he expressed his conviction that he had not long to
survive&mdash;an apprehension which was confirmed by his kind and
afflicted medical friend.&nbsp; Having called his family round
him, he addressed them in his own peculiarly affectionate and
earnest manner, upon the solemn change he was soon to undergo,
blessed them, and presently after sunk to his rest, so calmly and
quietly that they knew not of his departure until the mournful
event was communicated by Dr. Paget.&nbsp; About two hours only
had elapsed between the occurrence of the accident and his
death.</p>
<p>The servant who had driven him, was thrown also with great
violence against a heap of stones, and severely hurt; but he is
now, we are happy to say, recovering.</p>
<p>The well-known excellencies of Mr. Mortimer in every Christian
sphere and relation, render any extended remarks of our own
unnecessary.&nbsp; He was all that the mind can conceive, in this
imperfect state, of a gentle, consistent, and established
Christian.&nbsp; With talents and acquirements of the highest
order, a polished mind and a benevolent heart, he was fitted to
adorn any society; while the zealous and conscientious discharge
of every pastoral duty to which his strength was equal, added to
a large and systematic charity, endeared him, in a peculiar
degree, to <a name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
247</span>the flock who were so fortunate as to enjoy his
ministrations.</p>
<p>In the diocese at large, as a well-informed, pious, and
influential clergyman, his loss will be severely felt; a loss the
more afflictive to many, from the very recent opportunity
occurring at the late visitation, where he attended apparently in
unusual health, of enjoying the benefits and gratification of his
society.</p>
<p>He has gone to his rest in a mature, though not old age; and,
in the words of a contemporary, &ldquo;the chief consolation to
the family and friends of this truly good man will be, that he
died in the full assurance of entering into the perfect
realization of the true believer&rsquo;s promised
happiness.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Melancholy Accident</span>.&mdash;It has
seldom been our task to announce a more truly melancholy accident
than that which, on Saturday evening, deprived the diocese of
Toronto of one of its most zealous, useful, and truly respected
clergymen, the Rev. George Mortimer, of Thornhill. * * * * * * *
Few men could have moved in a sphere of more active Christian
usefulness than this most excellent minister of religion.&nbsp;
To the poor, and the neighbourhood generally, of Thornhill, his
death will be a severe loss.&nbsp; His charities were large, and
extended to the bounds of his clerical remuneration and a large
private income.&nbsp; The chief consolation to the family and
friends of this truly Christian man will be, that he died in the
full assurance of entering into the perfect realization of the
true believer&rsquo;s promised happiness.</p>

<h3>(<i>From the Bristol Journal</i>.)<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE REV. GEORGE MORTIMER, M.A.</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">With</span> deep regret and affectionate
esteem, we record the death of one, whose memory (we are
persuaded) is embalmed in the hearts of many among our
fellow-citizens&mdash;the <span class="smcap">Rev. George
Mortimer</span>.&nbsp; In the midst of his ministerial usefulness
in Upper Canada, whither he emigrated from this city about ten
years ago, his valuable life was suddenly terminated by one of
those mysterious dispensations of Infinite Wisdom, which, while
they make us feel our deep ignorance, exercise at once
reverential submission and Christian confidence.&nbsp; Thrown
from an open carriage against the stump of a tree, he received a
fatal injury on his chest; and having been carried to his home,
and placed on his bed, he expired within two hours.&nbsp; It is
remarkable that, as a fall, suffered in his infancy, had injured
his growth, and distorted his person, a fall should have proved
the occasion of his death.&nbsp; For several years (between 1826
and 1834) he resided in this neighbourhood; first at Horfield,
when he officiated as evening preacher at St. Mary-le-Port, in
this city; afterwards, as curate of the Rev. Alfred Harford, at
Hutton, in Somerset.&nbsp; He was a man equally distinguished by
his intellectual and Christian excellence.&nbsp; The strength and
symmetry of his mental constitution presented a striking contrast
and relief to the <a name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
250</span>imperfection of his stature and his
form&mdash;imperfection redeemed by a countenance eloquently
expressive of benignity blended with intelligence.&nbsp; Those
who enjoyed his personal intimacy will remember him long among
the most instructive and interesting of companions&mdash;among
the most kind and faithful of friends.&nbsp; As a preacher, he
was eminently popular, powerful, and profitable; peculiarly
excelling in accurate details of practical and social duty, and
also in discriminative representations of the character and the
heart.&nbsp; A mind acute, perspicuous, methodical, enriched with
knowledge at once varied and exact; a natural <i>unwritten</i>
eloquence, aided by a voice of peculiar and pathetic
tone&mdash;imparted an extraordinary charm to those evening
discourses, which, delivered to crowded auditories in St.
Mary-le-Port Church, have left, we doubt not, vivid and valued
impressions on the memory and the heart of many a surviving
hearer.&nbsp; At this moment we well recollect particular
passages of his preaching; and especially his farewell address,
heard with mournful eagerness by an overflowing throng on the
evening of the day preceding his departure for America: the text,
&ldquo;Choose ye this day whom ye will serve!&rdquo;&mdash;the
sermon, a masterpiece of comprehensive and momentous
exhortation.&nbsp; On the next morning (Monday) in company with
many of his attached friends and hearers, &ldquo;we accompanied
him to the ship, sorrowing most of all for this, <i>that we
should see his face no more</i>.&rdquo; (Acts, xx. 38.)&nbsp; Our
Canadian colony, then the scene of large emigration, and greatly
in need of able clergymen, rejoiced to receive the treasure which
Bristol once enjoyed.&nbsp; By his natural and acquired
endowments, Mr. Mortimer was singularly qualified for usefulness
in the new field of his ministry.&nbsp; In his extensive parish
of Thornhill, the parish church was considerably enlarged during
the year preceding his last, towards which he contributed <a
name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 251</span>greatly;
and also effected the establishment of two other churches, with
clergymen attached to them, in the same extensive district.&nbsp;
During a long course of years, Mr. M&mdash; had made it his rule
to expend a <i>tenth</i> part of his income annually, on the
various objects of Christian benevolence: his liberality must
have proved doubly valuable, where, while numerous necessities
demanded relief, the people are generally <i>slow to
give</i>.&nbsp; In what high esteem he was held by his Canadian
brethren, is sufficiently attested by the extraordinary honours
of his funeral: the Bishop of Toronto, accompanied by more than
forty clergymen, many from distant places, attended his remains
to their sepulchral rest, with tears of mingled love and
grief.&nbsp; He has left an excellent widow and six children to
lament his loss, and cherish his memory.&nbsp; Of his sons, two
are engaged in the ministry; one as a missionary among the
Chippeway Indians, and the youngest is studying in the College of
Toronto for the same sacred destination.&nbsp; May the spirit of
their father be perpetuated in his children&rsquo;s children.</p>

<h3>TO MISS ELIZA FORD.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Thornhill, September 25, 1844.</p>
<p>My dear Madam,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> compliance with the wishes
expressed in your letter to Mamma, and at her request, I proceed
to retrace the latest years of my dear father&rsquo;s life.&nbsp;
Though it is in some respects a painful task, and one for which I
feel myself incompetent, I shall be quite repaid if I afford any
pleasure to the respected and valued friends of my late beloved
father.</p>
<p><a name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 252</span>I
think you must have heard of the distressing nervous attack which
my dear father had about four years since, and which, for a time,
entirely incapacitated him for the discharge of his ministerial
duties, and obliged him to engage the services of a curate.&nbsp;
When he had partially recovered, but, at the same time, felt
unequal to the resumption of his ministrations at Thornhill, he
undertook a service in a retired place, nearly four miles
distant, where no church service had been before held.&nbsp; He
felt very much interested in this self-imposed charge, which he
termed, in speaking of it to me, the nursling of his old
age.&nbsp; Many of the members of this congregation, which
consisted entirely of farmers, mechanics, and labourers, have
frequently spoken in strong terms of gratitude for his attention
to them, and I hope that his labours there were in some measure
appreciated.&nbsp; When he afterwards gave Mr. Townley some
assistance in Thornhill Church, <a name="citation252"></a><a
href="#footnote252" class="citation">[252]</a> he still continued
his exposition, as he was accustomed to call it, at the German
Mills, but then went only once a fortnight, and my youngest
brother, with the consent of the bishop, officiated as
lay-reader, on the alternate Sundays.&nbsp; At the end of June,
in last year, my dear father having felt very anxious to resume
his charge at Thornhill, at length came to the determination of
dismissing his curate, notwithstanding the fears of his family
that he would be unequal to bear the sole burden of the then
greatly increased parochial duties.&nbsp; Connected with this
determination, was a resolution to devote himself entirely to his
ministerial work, and he re-entered upon it with renewed zeal and
ardour.&nbsp; At the same <a name="page253"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 253</span>time he entirely gave up all his
literary pursuits, and, as if to confirm his purpose, removed
from his study all the geological and other scientific works,
which had previously engaged and captivated his attention.&nbsp;
This was an evident and great sacrifice, but it was made with
cheerfulness for the sake of his Divine Redeemer; and the comfort
and great peace of mind which he enjoyed in doing his
Master&rsquo;s work, fully recompensed him for this act of
self-devotion.&nbsp; Our fears respecting his health proved to
have been groundless, for he frequently said that he never felt
his ministerial duties less oppressive than he then did.&nbsp;
The good health which he enjoyed was greatly promoted by the
practice which he had adopted of driving out regularly every day,
and which he then continued both for the benefit of the exercise,
and also for the purpose of visiting his parishioners, very many
of whom lived at a distance of many miles.&nbsp; His visits have
been frequently alluded to, and they appear to have been prized
by many, as marks of kindness and condescension, when they could
not appreciate their spiritual advantage.&nbsp; During this last
year of my dear father&rsquo;s life, owing perhaps to the
exclusively religious nature of his studies, his conversation
much more frequently than before took a serious turn.&nbsp; I was
frequently much struck with the beauty of his observations, and
at times the thought occurred that his remarks were those of one
ripening for glory.&nbsp; At the end of last May, Arthur and his
bride came to visit us, and we then effected a family meeting,
every member being present excepting Maria.&nbsp; During the next
week, my dear father was present at the bishop&rsquo;s triennial
visitation, and at the annual meeting of our Diocesan Church
Society; and his apparent good health was generally remarked by
his clerical and other friends.&nbsp; The ceremony of opening a
church in our neighbourhood, occurring in the following week, he
<a name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 254</span>thought
it his duty to attend; but these exertions, combined with the
excitement of an enlarged family circle, affected his health, and
on that account, during the three last days he spent the whole of
his time in parochial visiting.&nbsp; The man-servant spoke with
much feeling of his conversation during their drives, and
mentioned his having said, each day, when they reached home,
&ldquo;Once more, Stephen, God has brought us home in
safety.&rdquo;&nbsp; Some of the persons that he visited on those
days remarked to a young friend, that their minister spoke to
them particularly of preparation for death.&nbsp; On Saturday,
the 15th of June, having heard that his bookseller in Toronto had
received a supply of new books, he determined upon going there to
select some theological works.&nbsp; While he was waiting for the
carriage, he returned to the dining-room, and talked in a very
lively manner till it was ready.&nbsp; He had only proceeded
about a mile on his journey, when the fatal accident
occurred.&nbsp; The newspapers gave a correct account of the
accident, which perhaps you have heard&mdash;that the horse ran
away; that one rein broke suddenly, though nearly new, which
caused the horse to make so sudden and violent a turn, that the
carriage was overturned, and that the man, though thrown out as
well as his master, was only slightly injured, while the latter
received his deathblow on the chest, by being thrown with
violence against the stump of a tree.&nbsp; It had long been the
practice of my endeared father, and one which he recommended from
the pulpit, to make death a daily subject of prayer, and a part
of that, I believe, daily petition, was that he might, if
consistent with the will of God, have an easy death.&nbsp; The
testimony of his kind and skilful medical attendant, is a
decisive evidence to the striking fulfilment of this prayer; for
he told us that no other death was so easy, excepting when
occasioned by lightning, as that <a name="page255"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 255</span>which terminated the existence of my
dear father, who, he assured us, suffered no pain.&nbsp; He also
mentioned that he considered it a very remarkable circumstance,
that he should have survived so long a time as four hours: for
that two hours was deemed the utmost length of time that life
could be prolonged, under such circumstances, and that instant
death was the frequent result of such a blow.&nbsp; That such was
not the case in this instance, we felt very thankful, and he
himself expressed his satisfaction at being brought home to his
own bed, and his thankfulness that none of his bones were broken;
not knowing then the fatal nature of his accident.&nbsp; He
expressed a desire that some of his family should leave the room,
that he might be quiet, and we all therefore quitted his room,
excepting Dr. Paget and Arthur.&nbsp; He was perfectly composed,
and resigned to the will of God, whatever that might be, but
expressed a wish that he might fall asleep in Jesus.&nbsp; When
he became aware, or rather suspected, that his end was
approaching, he sent for all the members of his family who were
then at home, mentioning us by name, and we received in
succession his last blessing.&nbsp; He was then perfectly calm,
and in a peaceful state of mind.&nbsp; Almost his last words were
expressive of his admiration of, and thankfulness for, the
wonderful plan of redemption: his words I do not remember
accurately enough to quote, but his last petition was for his
beloved flock!&nbsp; Dr. Paget, though his affectionate heart
felt deep sorrow, said, that it was a privilege to witness such a
death.&nbsp; The testimony which has been borne by all ranks to
the esteem in which he was held, is very gratifying.&nbsp; The
bishop came from Toronto, though with great inconvenience, to pay
the last mark of respect to the dear remains of one whom, to the
credit of both parties, he greatly respected, though differing
from him in many points.&nbsp; The church was greatly <a
name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 256</span>crowded on
the mournful occasion, and a deep feeling appeared to pervade the
assembly.&nbsp; The pulpit, &amp;c. were hung with black cloth,
and all the genteel residents in the neighbourhood put on
mourning.&nbsp; These are the consolations which the world has in
its power to offer to mourning relatives, and very many have we
received, nor were they by any means undervalued by us, but,
added to them, we had far higher sources of comfort, in the
perfect assurance that he whom we mourned had entered into his
rest, and in the full assurance that the event, deeply afflicting
as it was to us, was ordered by an allwise and gracious God.</p>
<p>Mamma desires her Christian respects to yourself and your dear
sister, of whose very afflictive state of deprivation of almost
every outward comfort, she was truly grieved to hear.</p>
<p>My dear father was much affected when he heard, through Miss
B&mdash;, the sad intelligence, and he more than once alluded to
your dear sister&rsquo;s blindness with tears of sympathy.</p>

yours,<br />

<p>The following letter, written by the same hand, repeats so
much of what was said in the foregoing, that at first the writer
of these memoirs determined, on the omission of one of them: but,
upon consideration that, though there was repetition, there was
also so much variety of expression, as well as of additional
matter, he judged it best to insert both&mdash;a judgment which
he doubts not will be approved by his readers.</p>
<h3><a name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 257</span>TO
MRS. HOLLAND.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Thornhill, Feb. 8, 1845.</p>
<p>My dear Aunt,</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * * * * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;The memory of the just is&rdquo; indeed
&ldquo;blessed&rdquo;; and I wish that the last remembrances of
my beloved father could have been traced for you by a more able
hand than mine.&nbsp; His memory is, I am sure, treasured in the
hearts of very many here who knew him.&nbsp; I wish it may incite
them to follow him as he followed Christ.</p>
<p>The last year of my beloved father&rsquo;s life was marked by
an entire devotion to his ministerial work; for when he came to
the determination of resuming the entire charge of his parish, it
was accompanied by a resolution to abandon every other pursuit,
and to devote all his time and powers to the one object of
winning souls to Christ.&nbsp; As if to confirm this purpose, he
put away from his study library all the geological and other
scientific and literary books with which it was furnished, and
replenished it with theological works.&nbsp; It was to him an act
of great self-denial thus entirely to give up the studies and
pursuits which had previously so engaged and captivated his
attention; but they were relinquished with cheerfulness, because
for his Redeemer&rsquo;s sake; for he observed at the time that
he made this sacrifice, &ldquo;Oh! it is a very little thing to
do for my Saviour.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was fully recompensed for this
devotion to his Heavenly Father&rsquo;s cause, as appears from
his having expressed to mamma the great comfort and peace of mind
which he afterwards enjoyed in his clerical avocations.&nbsp;
From that time a change was apparent in his conversation; for
although he was always accustomed to introduce <a
name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 258</span>religious
subjects in conversation with his family, especially in the
evening, when he would sit with us for a short time after family
prayers, still, during the last year, his conversation, partaking
of the exclusive nature of his studies, was more uniformly
serious than it had been previously.&nbsp; I was frequently much
struck with the beauty and spirituality of his observations, and,
once or twice, while listening to his conversation, the idea
presented itself, that the sentiments and feelings he expressed
were those of one who was ripening for the garner.&nbsp; This,
however, was merely a passing thought, and never at all realized
or dwelt upon; for my dear father was, at that time, particularly
well, and he frequently told us that he never felt his
ministerial duties less burdensome.&nbsp; One of his remarks,
which made an impression on my mind at the time, has since struck
me the more from the coincidence of the following text being
written in one of the blank leaves of the Bible that he was
accustomed to use, until within the last two or three years of
his life: &ldquo;When I am old and grey-headed, O God, forsake me
not.&rdquo;&nbsp; Psalm lxxi. 18.&nbsp; The remark which he made
in conversation was this: &ldquo;He has been my God from my youth
up, but I never felt that he was so near to me as now in my old
age.&rdquo;&nbsp; These are not, I think, quite the expressions
he made use of, for I quote from memory, and although I attempted
to write them down the same day, I could not even then recall the
<i>words</i> that he used.&nbsp; Often similar attempts that I
made failed also, and I then relinquished the idea that I had
entertained, of preserving in writing some of my endeared
father&rsquo;s religious observations.&nbsp; During one of our
drives to the station at the German Mills, speaking of the
ministering of angels, a subject of which he was very fond, he
remarked, that the dispensation of <i>faith</i> under which we
are placed made it necessary that an unseen agency <a
name="page259"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 259</span>should be
employed for our protection and deliverance, as otherwise faith
would be lost in sight; and also that, had these ministering
spirits been made visible to us, we should have been very prone
to place our reliance upon <i>them</i>, instead of putting our
trust simply in God.&nbsp; He pursued the conversation as we
ascended a very steep hill, and said, &ldquo;I think we are
little aware how constantly angels are employed on our behalf;
perhaps now, an angel is leading that horse by the bridle, and
encouraging it onwards.&rdquo;&nbsp; One of the horses, a fine
animal, was then exerting itself to the utmost; for the roads
were very bad at the time, and the hill was therefore very
difficult of ascent.&nbsp; I think the following anecdote will be
interesting to you, as it is one which made a strong impression
on my dear father&rsquo;s mind, and, as it is short, I am tempted
to copy it for you: &ldquo;As one said to Philip J. Jenks just
before he expired, &lsquo;How hard it is to die,&rsquo; he
replied, &lsquo;Oh, no, easy dying, blessed dying, glorious
dying.&rsquo;&nbsp; Looking up at the clock, he said, &lsquo;I
have experienced more happiness in dying this day, than in my
whole life.&nbsp; It is worth living for, it is worth a whole
life, to have such an end as this.&nbsp; I have long desired that
I might glorify God in my death; but oh!&nbsp; I never thought
that such a poor worm as I could have come to such a glorious
death.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; I believe this account of
&ldquo;happiness experienced in death,&rdquo; contributed very
much to weaken his apprehension of the pains of death, which he
afterwards entirely lost.&nbsp; It had, however, long been his
own practice, and one which he recommended to others from the
pulpit, to make death a daily subject of prayer, particularly as
regarded its <i>time</i> and <i>manner</i>; and I believe one of
these daily petitions was, that he might have an easy death, if
consistent with the will of God.&nbsp; This petition was answered
by his Heavenly Father in a striking manner, for our kind <a
name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 260</span>friend and
physician assured us, that he suffered <i>no pain</i>, not even
so much as a person experiences in fainting.&nbsp; It is also
remarkable, as Dr. Paget mentioned to us, that in no other way
could his existence have been terminated with this absence of
pain, except by a stroke of lightning.&nbsp; The doctor also
considered it remarkable that he survived so long after the fatal
accident, as instant death frequently occurs under such
circumstances.&nbsp; That such was not his case was an
unspeakable comfort to us; and he himself expressed his
satisfaction at being brought home to his own comfortable
bed.&nbsp; He also stated his thankfulness for the circumstance
of no bone being broken, or even dislocated, and quoted that
passage of Scripture, &ldquo;He keepeth all his bones, not one of
them is broken.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was before he was aware of the
fatal nature of the accident.&nbsp; He expressed a wish to be
left alone that he might be quiet, and we all left the room in
consequence, except Arthur and Dr. Paget.&nbsp; We had no idea
that any danger was to be apprehended, till a few moments before
he expired, when he sent for us, asking for each by name, and for
the servants also.&nbsp; He said he thought he was dying, and
added, &ldquo;Do not be surprised if I should struggle at the
last.&rdquo;&nbsp; Immediately after he said, &ldquo;What a
salvation is that which Christ has purchased for us; what a
blessing that I have nothing to do now!&nbsp; My dear flock, may
the Lord bless them all, and provide for them!&rdquo;&nbsp; Then
seeing us all around him, he said to each, &ldquo;May the Lord
bless you.&rdquo;&nbsp; These were his last words, except the
expression of his wish to lie down.&nbsp; I supported his head on
my arm, and thought that he was falling asleep&mdash;but no, it
was the sleep of death.</p>
<p>Mr. Osier preached a most excellent funeral sermon from this
appropriate text, &ldquo;Blessed are those servants, whom their
Lord, when he cometh, shall find <a name="page261"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 261</span>watching.&rdquo;&nbsp; My dear
father was employed to the very last in doing his Lord&rsquo;s
work: his three last days were spent entirely in parochial
visiting, contrary to his usual practice of spending the greater
portion of each day in his study, and two or three hours in his
drives and in visiting his people.&nbsp; Some of those whom he
visited on these days, afterwards told a young friend, that he
talked to them principally about preparation for death.&nbsp; The
man-servant also has spoken with much feeling of his conversation
during those drives, and he mentioned also, that each day, when
they reached home, he said, &ldquo;Once more, Stephen, God has
brought us home in safety.&rdquo;&nbsp; My beloved father&rsquo;s
consistency of conduct won for him the respect and esteem of all
who knew him, even of those who differed from him, sometimes
widely, in religious opinions.&nbsp; Such was the case with the
bishop, who however not only respected him, but entertained very
kind feelings towards him, which he evinced by coming from
Toronto, though with great inconvenience, and unsolicited, to pay
the last mark of respect to his remains.&nbsp; The public
testimony which was borne to the excellence of my dear
father&rsquo;s character, in a resolution of the Central Board of
the Church Society, of which body he was a member, was so
gratifying, that I cannot refrain from copying a part of
it.&nbsp; He is spoken of in the resolution as one &ldquo;who for
warm yet humble piety, enlarged and Christian charity, a
self-denying course of life, and a holy devotedness to his
Heavenly Master&rsquo;s cause, was surpassed by none of those who
have been commissioned to feed the flock of Christ in this
diocese.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the features of character alluded to in this resolution
had been especially observed by a young clerical friend, who,
when speaking with much warmth of the high estimation he
entertained of my dear father&rsquo;s character, particularly
mentioned his <a name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
262</span><i>great humility</i>.&nbsp; As an instance of this, he
told us, that, when he had gone with my father into the vestry
after preaching what Mr. D. considered a most excellent sermon,
he had spoken of it as furnishing cause for fresh humiliation,
and a stimulus to greater exertions and more earnest prayers for
the future.&nbsp; Mr. D., on the same occasion, alluded to the
peculiar facility with which he constantly introduced religious
remarks in conversation, which, he said, he had particularly
noticed on the few occasions on which he had met him in
company.&nbsp; In answer to an observation, that my dear father
had often deplored the want of this very gift, Mr. D. remarked,
that this circumstance afforded a fresh proof of his
humility.</p>

class="citation">[262]</a> (well fitted to form a correct

of a very finished kind, lucid in order, striking in
illustration, and powerful in application.&nbsp; These discourses
were not the mere effusions of thoughts unprepared and of matter
undigested, but the result of diligent reading, close study, and
fervent prayer, which alone can enable even the competent
<i>extempore</i> speaker to address a Christian congregation with
any good effect.&nbsp; He was eminently a <a
name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 263</span>practical
preacher, and signally excelled in pourtraying the unfair arts so
often practised by men of business with a view to their worldly
gain: and, as his hearers were mostly tradesmen, his graphic
delineations were sometimes keenly felt in the consciences of
individuals, who were ready to say, &ldquo;Art thou come to call
our sins to our remembrance?&rdquo;&nbsp; More than one of his
mercantile hearers has asked him, in private intercourse, by what
means he had acquired so exact and extraordinary an acquaintance
with the varieties of fraud, which, however familiar in the busy
walks of trade, might be supposed little known to a minister of
the gospel.&nbsp; To such a question he has replied, that he had
derived his knowledge, partly from the habitual study of his own
heart, partly from his personal experience of a busy life in his
earlier years; as he had been apprenticed to an eminent London
bookseller, previously to his collegiate preparation for the
ministry.</p>
<p>So searchingly did he probe the consciences of his hearers,
that it was not unfrequent with some among them to visit him for
the purpose of private conference, counsel, and
consolation.&nbsp; He well knew how to &ldquo;speak a word in
season to the weary,&rdquo; with a peculiar sympathy and
kindness.&nbsp; Yet quite as well he knew how to apply &ldquo;the
terror of the Lord:&rdquo; and I remember his telling me, that
one of the <i>most effective</i> sermons (as he had reason to
believe) which he had ever preached, was of terrific character,
and founded on those words of overwhelming horror; &ldquo;In Hell
he lifted up his eyes, being in torments.&rdquo;&nbsp;
<i>That</i> sermon (he had reason to hope) had been used by the
Lord as an instrument for rescuing &ldquo;a brand from the
burning,&rdquo; which the preacher aimed to represent.&nbsp;
Another of his most striking sermons, divided between the morning
and evening of the same Sabbath, was formed on a theme contrasted
with the preceding, the <i>conduct</i> and the <i>reward</i> of
the faithful <a name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
264</span>Christian, as exemplified in St. <span
class="smcap">Paul</span>: &ldquo;I have fought the good fight, I
have finished my course, I have kept the faith: henceforth there
is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the
righteous Judge, shall give me at that day.&rdquo; <a
name="citation264"></a><a href="#footnote264"
class="citation">[264]</a></p>
<p>But, whatever excellencies he possessed as a preacher, Mr.
Mortimer was unconscious of them himself: for he frequently
deplored what he considered the inefficiency of his
ministrations, and was accustomed to speak in the most humble
terms of his sermons.&nbsp; On one such occasion, he said,
&ldquo;When I come out of the pulpit, and turn over in my mind
what I have said, I think, What does it all amount to?&nbsp; How
much more to the purpose it might have been, and how much more
useful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the Sunday evenings, after committing his past endeavours
into the hands of his God by prayer, he would turn his thoughts
from the review of what he considered his past failures to the
hope of future usefulness, by at once renewing his
exertions.&nbsp; With this view, he was accustomed, before he
retired to rest on the Sunday evening, to look out a text for the
following Sunday, and to form the outline of the sermon.&nbsp;
But although he was thus peculiarly anxious about the preparation
of his sermons, he seldom spoke on the subject without remarking
upon the necessity of the accompanying influences of the Holy
Spirit, to render efficacious even the most highly wrought,
powerful, and most convincing sermon.&nbsp; Indeed, he has
expressed the opinion, that the most common-place sermons were
often made the most useful; because, in such cases, the preacher,
being aware of their defects, and being thus divested of all
feelings of self-congratulation, was led, in more <a
name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 265</span>humble
dependence upon God, to entreat that He would give the
increase.</p>
<p>In connexion with this subject, he once mentioned having
preached for a friend on a rainy day to an exceedingly small
congregation.&nbsp; The comparatively large number of empty pews
presented a very discouraging aspect, and tended very much to
depress his spirits;&mdash;altogether such was the effect
produced on his mind, that least of all on that day would he have
expected any favourable result from his sermon.&nbsp; Some time
afterwards, when he was spending an evening at the house of a
person who resided at some distance both from the place where he
preached and from his own home, a lady, who was of the party,
took an opportunity of stating how much she felt indebted to him
for the spiritual sight that she had received through his
instrumentality.&nbsp; He was at a loss to know what she alluded
to, for he had no recollection of having seen her before: but she
brought to his recollection the thinly scattered congregation in
his friend&rsquo;s church, for whom he had preached on a very
rainy day: and then stated that she was one of those few hearers,
and that the sermon had made so deep an impression on her mind as
to have been productive of lasting benefit.</p>
<h3>PASTORAL VISITING.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> his pastoral visits, Mr.
Mortimer appears to have been remarkably successful.&nbsp; He
seems always to have paid attention to this very important and
often very useful part of the Christian pastor&rsquo;s office,
but more especially during a few of the latter years of his life,
making his daily drives for the benefit of his health subservient
to that purpose.&nbsp; He made a point of visiting at first six,
and afterwards ten families during each week, by which
arrangement he <a name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
266</span>considered that he could visit each family four times
during the year, besides paying more frequent visits in case of
illness, or any particular affliction.&nbsp; He not only visited
the different members of his congregation and others belonging to
the church, but he went to every house in the immediate
neighbourhood, and, for several miles around, he knew the
occupants of almost every house.&nbsp; When he visited Roman
Catholics, or Dissenters, he never sought to enter into
controversy with them; for he considered it, in general,
unprofitable, and seldom productive of the desired effect of
bringing them into the fold of the Church.&nbsp; He was far,
however, from shrinking from entering upon the subject, when it
appeared desirable for him to do so; and when the subject was
brought forward in conversation, he stated the grounds of his
firm adhesion to his own communion, and conscientiously, but with
a mild and affectionate manner, warned them of the sin of
schism.&nbsp; On such occasions, <i>unity</i> was generally the
theme of his discourse, and he would dwell much on its importance
and obligations, and urge upon them the consideration of that
beautiful prayer, &ldquo;That they, Father, may be one, as we
are.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was never satisfied unless he could give a
decided religious turn to the conversations he had with his
people, but, even if he failed in doing this, he always contrived
to introduce some serious remark before he left their
houses.&nbsp; A Presbyterian, who was warmly attached to her own
Church, when speaking of Mr. Mortimer, said, &ldquo;Ah, he was a
real good man.&nbsp; I have often said, that he and Mr. J. [the
minister of her own communion] were the two best ministers in
Canada.&nbsp; I wouldna miss going to hear Mr. Mortimer preach in
the evening [she went to her own place of worship in the
morning], but I havena the heart to go now.&nbsp; I weel remember
how he sat here, for near an hour, talking to my husband the last
time he was here.&nbsp; <a name="page267"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 267</span>My husband served at Waterloo, and
they were talking about the battle, and such things; and then he
stopped all of a sudden, and smiled, and said, &lsquo;but I didna
come here to talk about politics.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was particularly desirous of impressing upon the minds of
those whom he visited the importance of individual and
experimental religion, and would constantly remind them that
their great aim should be to prepare for heaven.</p>
<p>He took also occasion to warn them of open sins which they
were in the habit of committing, such as drunkenness, or the
neglect of public worship.&nbsp; An old man, who frequently gave
way to a habit of intoxication, and, perhaps from this cause, has
now become prematurely infirm and almost childish, alluded to the
last visit of his pastor in the following manner:&mdash;&ldquo;On
the Thursday&mdash;the Thursday, you mind, before he
died&mdash;old Mr. Mortimer came to see me in his little
carriage, and his man drove him: and he gave me a caution.&nbsp;
He said, &lsquo;Mr. &mdash;, I saw you on Yonge-street a short
time since, and you were drunk;&rsquo; and on the next Saturday
he was a corpse, and I lost my brother:&rdquo; and the old man
turned aside to hide his tears.</p>
<p>The husband, or rather the widower, of a Presbyterian,
mentioned that his wife had frequently remarked to him, that
there could not be a better minister by a sick bed than Mr.
Mortimer: for that he never excited persons, but that at the same
time he did not delude them about their eternal prospects, but
spoke candidly to them, according to their different states of
mind.&nbsp; She said that there was no minister that she should
so much like to see, if she were ill, as Mr. Mortimer.&nbsp; Her
wish, however, was not gratified, for she survived him about
half-a-year.</p>
<p>Another person, a member of a Presbyterian family in the
neighbourhood, after stating that Mr. Mortimer was very much
missed, said, &ldquo;And no one <a name="page268"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 268</span>misses him more than my mother; for
he used to come and sit with her, and talked so nicely to her,
that it did her so much good&mdash;it did her good till he came
again.&nbsp; There will never be another minister like Mr.
Mortimer: if there were to come five thousand, there would not be
another like him.&rdquo; <a name="citation268a"></a><a
href="#footnote268a" class="citation">[268a]</a></p>
<p>He took an interest in the concerns of those whom he visited,
and, following the example of St. Paul, strove to &ldquo;please
all men in all things, not seeking his own profit, but the profit
of many, that they might be saved.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He was not
naturally fond of children, and I was much struck, on that
account, with the remark of a woman when talking about the visits
of my dear father; &lsquo;Ah, miss, your father was mighty fond
of this little one, and he took so much notice of him the very
last time he was here!&rsquo;&nbsp; Another woman said,
&lsquo;Ah! he was a real gentleman, and he would sit down with
us, and talk so free and pleasant-like.&rsquo;&rdquo; <a
name="citation268b"></a><a href="#footnote268b"
class="citation">[268b]</a></p>
<h3><a name="page269"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
269</span>CONFIRMATION.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Mortimer</span> devoted a good deal of
time and attention to preparing the candidates for the
confirmation that was held at Thornhill, in July, 1843.&nbsp; Mr.
Townley was then assisting him; for he began the instruction of
the candidates several months previous to the solemnizing of the
rite, and he was thus left more at liberty than he had ever
before been for this important branch of duty.&nbsp; His plan, on
that occasion, was to divide the candidates into three distinct
classes; viz., one comprising the juniors, and another, the
adults of the less educated among his congregation, and the third
embracing the remainder.&nbsp; The first of these classes was
required to learn by heart portions of an explanation of the
Church Catechism, which they repeated to their minister when they
met together on a specified afternoon in each week.&nbsp; Their
attention was particularly directed to the Scripture proofs of
the Catechism, which was also commented upon in a familiar
manner, and particularly in connexion with confirmation.&nbsp; In
order to encourage them to learn the Catechism well, a prize was
promised to each of the three who should be able to repeat the
whole of it most accurately.&nbsp; The adult classes met also
once a week in the evening, and were prepared with answers, which
they read from the Bible, to questions on scriptural subjects,
with which they were furnished the previous week.&nbsp; They also
repeated a part of Dean Nowell&rsquo;s Catechism, which, together
with the scriptural questions, formed the subject for addresses
and interrogations.&nbsp; The third class met one morning in the
week at their pastor&rsquo;s house, and they were expected to
give verbal answers to questions on the Book of Common Prayer,
with which they were <a name="page270"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 270</span>previously supplied.&nbsp; For the
use of this class also, Mr. Mortimer prepared a set of questions
and answers explanatory of the sacrament, which will appear in
another place; and he made use of a Catechism on Confirmation to
explain that ordinance to the candidates, besides distributing
several tracts on the subject.</p>
<h3>SOCIAL MEETINGS.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the years 1842 and 1843, Mr.
Mortimer established several different week-day meetings for
promoting the spiritual benefit of his flock.&nbsp; One of these
was held on Tuesday evenings, and was conducted alternately by
himself and Mr. Townley, both, however, being present.&nbsp; The
meeting was opened by singing a hymn, and by offering up a short
extempore prayer, either by himself or Mr. Townley.&nbsp; One of
them then spoke on some subject connected with experimental
religion; after which, some of the members were expected to make
observations connected with the spiritual life of the Christian,
or their own particular experience, or to ask any question on
practical or doctrinal subjects; and, when a pause ensued, one of
the clergymen would carry on the remarks, or introduce another
subject.&nbsp; Singing the doxology, and the use of one or two
collects, or, occasionally, extempore prayer, and the blessing,
concluded the meeting.&nbsp; This meeting was not continued long;
for it was not found to answer, owing to the difficulty that
persons experienced in speaking on these subjects.</p>
<p>After this was given up, another was established for the
Sunday-school teachers.&nbsp; There were twelve members, all
young, in the same rank of society, and on terms of intimacy with
each other and with their respected pastor, at whose house they
met; <a name="page271"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 271</span>and
these circumstances, together with the cheerful easy manner in
which it was conducted, combined to render it pleasant, as well
as profitable.&nbsp; Each member learnt by heart a short portion
of a catechetical work on the &ldquo;Elements of Christian
Knowledge,&rdquo; which they repeated by turns, and afterwards
gave verbal answers to questions, previously written out, on
miscellaneous subjects connected with religion, such as the
evidences of Christianity, the history of the Old Testament, or
doctrinal subjects.&nbsp; Questions were prepared by Mr. Mortimer
for this purpose, and other questions were copied by the
different members from a book of &ldquo;Questions on the Old and
New Testament, and the Book of Common Prayer, by the Rev. Edward
Thompson.&rdquo;&nbsp; The different subjects thus brought
forward, always drew forth many interesting and profitable
remarks in connexion with the duties of Sunday-school
teachers.&nbsp; At other times, they were addressed as professors
of Christianity.&nbsp; These meetings were very much liked, and
are still looked back upon with feelings of pleasure and grateful
recollection by, at least, some of its members.&nbsp; They only
lasted one winter, as the summer evenings were not found so
convenient for them, and the following winter Mr. Mortimer was
unable to resume them, as his whole time was devoted to other
ministerial duties.</p>
<h3>LIBRARY.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the beginning of the year 1837,
Mr. Mortimer opened a &ldquo;Library for Sunday
Reading.&rdquo;&nbsp; It contained, at first, about 150 volumes,
and, as the books were very much read by all classes of persons,
about 100 more were afterwards added to the number, all of which
were furnished at his own cost.&nbsp; They were lent
gratuitously, and were changed weekly in <a
name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 272</span>the
vestry.&nbsp; The different readers were furnished with a printed
catalogue of the books, that they might have the opportunity of
selecting those that they preferred, as being most suitable to
their taste or circumstances.&nbsp; These books were in
circulation up to the time of his death.</p>
<p>About the same time an attempt was made to establish a
&ldquo;Library of Useful Knowledge,&rdquo; at Thornhill, the
object of which was to promote useful information to
&ldquo;Farmers, Mechanics, and Artizans,&rdquo; at a cost so
trifling as to bring it easily within their reach; the terms of
subscription being five shillings annually, or a penny-a-week for
each volume.&nbsp; This endeavour, which was made with the hope
of improving the habits and character of a large portion of the
population, by furnishing profitable employment for leisure hours
usually spent in idleness or frivolous amusements, was mainly
seconded by Mr. Mortimer, who made a handsome donation towards it
in money, besides about eighteen volumes, most of which, though
scientific or literary works, were distinguished for their
religious tendency.&nbsp; Most of the gentlemen in the
neighbourhood also contributed towards this library.&nbsp; It was
found, however, for the most part, that there was no taste for
this style of reading among the class for whom the library was
intended; only ten or a dozen persons availed themselves of the
use of the books, and in rather more than a year applications for
them ceased to be made.</p>
<h3>EXTRA-PAROCHIAL SERVICES.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was while visiting the people in
the neighbourhood of the <span class="smcap">German Mills</span>,
in August, 1841, that their state of spiritual destitution was
impressed upon Mr. Mortimer&rsquo;s mind, and he immediately <a
name="page273"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 273</span>determined
upon trying to do something for them.&nbsp; As he had then no
Sunday duty to perform, and, at the same time, was partially
recovered from his nervous attack, he made up his mind to attempt
a Sunday service there himself, and immediately began to inquire
if any room could be found for the purpose.&nbsp; A farmer, whose
house was very conveniently situated, on being applied to,
willingly consented to secure the use of a room in his own house,
without any charge, for the remaining term of his lease,
five-and-a-half years; nor would he at any time accept any
remuneration for the expense and trouble which he incurred by the
service being held in his house; and both himself and his wife
were ever ready to do all in their power to promote the comfort
of their minister, and of those who were engaged in the Sunday
school, which was also held in the room used for Divine
service.&nbsp; Their generous conduct much pleased Mr. Mortimer,
who often said, that they would never suffer for
&ldquo;sheltering the ark of God,&rdquo; but that, on the
contrary, he felt sure that as the &ldquo;Lord blessed the house
of Obededom,&rdquo; so He would bless them and their
family.&nbsp; The room being then in an unfinished state, Mr.
Mortimer agreed to have it prepared for Divine worship at his own
expense, the fitting up consisting simply of a desk and
benches.&nbsp; On the 5th of the following month, September, the
service was performed in this room for the first time.&nbsp; Mr.
Mortimer was much surprised, and greatly encouraged by the
largeness of the congregation, many being unable to find seats,
and standing in the entrance.&nbsp; Before the following Sunday
the room was furnished with additional benches, which,
altogether, was considered sufficient to seat a hundred
persons.&nbsp; On that day also, there was a large congregation,
as appears from a memorandum in Mr. Mortimer&rsquo;s handwriting;
&ldquo;The room quite filled, and overflowing.&rdquo;&nbsp; As he
himself <a name="page274"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
274</span>expected, however, after a time, the novelty wore off,
and the congregation decreased, leaving an average of about
seventy attendants; but even this number he thought a large
congregation, considering the scattered state of the
population.&nbsp; He always felt a peculiar interest in this
station, which he styled, &ldquo;the nursling of his old
age.&rdquo;&nbsp; The congregation always appeared grateful for
the establishment of the service there, which they evinced by the
willingness with which they subscribed to the &ldquo;Church
Society,&rdquo; when called upon to do so.&nbsp; Though this
place is not more than three-and-a-half miles from Thornhill
Church, it is believed, that not more than one person during
their residence there ever attended the church service, until it
was held at the German Mills.&nbsp; The settlement derives its
name from the circumstance of the surrounding country having been
settled chiefly by Germans many years since; at which time there
were mills close to the house in which the service is now
held.&nbsp; These mills have been long since in ruins, having
never been repaired, owing, it is said, to some superstition
connected with the history of them.&nbsp; There are now scarcely
more than two dozen houses within a circuit of half-a-mile from
the ruins of the mills.&nbsp; The other dwellings are scattered
on the different surrounding farms.</p>
<p>On the 10th October, in the same year, a Sunday School was
begun in connexion with the Church, which was well attended,
having from forty to sixty attendants.&nbsp; At the time the
Church service was established at the German Mills, there was no
Sunday service there of any description.&nbsp; The Methodists had
previously attempted to establish prayer and other meetings, but
had then no service of any kind: as soon, however, as the Church
service was commenced, Mr. Mortimer was informed that they had
again opened a meeting at a house close by, apparently for the
sake of opposition, but <a name="page275"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 275</span>of which he took not the slightest
notice: it was shortly afterwards given up, though in a little
time re-commenced.</p>
<p>In the same manner, when he was informed that the editor of
the <i>Christian Guardian</i>, a Methodist paper, had written
against him, he would not even look at the paper, observing, that
&ldquo;it matters but little what people said of
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; He considered it the wisest plan to let
opposition die away.&nbsp; By some he was called a Puseyite, by
others a low Churchman; but his own aim was to be &ldquo;a
consistent Churchman.&rdquo;&nbsp; What he considered one breach
of consistency is mentioned in his pastoral letter to his
parishioners at Thornhill; viz., attending other places of
worship: another was contributing towards the support or
encouragement of Dissent, which he invariably declined doing from
conscientious motives.</p>
<h3>CHARITY.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following memorandum is made in
his pocket-book for 1832:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;After I leave England, I purpose giving
one-seventh to poor-purse, as my object in devoting one fifth was
that I might more extensively employ the poor about my premises,
&amp;c. &amp;c.&nbsp; But as there is no want of labour there, so
large a proportion will not be needed: at least, it so strikes me
at present.&nbsp; Possibly, however, more will be needed for the
cause of God.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One way in which employment was given to the poor at Hutton
was, making a side walk through the village, covered with white
spar, which was procured from the neighbouring hills, and was
broken very small.&nbsp; His rector, the Rev. Alfred Harford,
shared in many of the plans which were adopted for the benefit of
the poor in Hutton.</p>
<p>Mr. Mortimer made a point of never being his own instrument in
affording pecuniary assistance to <a name="page276"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 276</span>any of the persons he visited.&nbsp;
If he noticed that any persons were in distressed circumstances,
or if any told him of their difficulties, he would mention them
to Mrs. Mortimer, and she would do what was necessary to relieve
them.&nbsp; Indeed, she was in every case his almoner; for he
never himself gave any money in charity.&nbsp; His reason for
this was, that the people might have no selfish aim in desiring
his visits, which he wished to be purely spiritual.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>As a <span class="GutSmall">HUSBAND</span> and a <span
class="GutSmall">FATHER</span>, Mr. Mortimer was a pattern of
conjugal tenderness and of parental kindness: there was a
remarkable suavity in his manners, which greatly endeared him to
his family, and indeed to all who had the pleasure of his
acquaintance.&nbsp; If ever he said or wrote an unkind word, he
was the first to discover and acknowledge it, and to make the
most ample apology.&nbsp; His humility was so great that it might
have been suspected of disingenuousness, if those who knew him
the most intimately were not well assured of his Christian
simplicity and sincerity.&nbsp; His youngest daughter, writing to
me, says, in reference to this subject:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;He kindly made me the companion of his
drives before he began to visit his people regularly, and he
frequently talked to me more as if I were his friend than his
daughter; for he would speak of his religious feelings, and even
of his faults.&nbsp; He once said that he had no wish to conceal
his sins and failings here; for that they would all be revealed
before the assembled multitudes of men and angels at the day of
judgment.&nbsp; I frequently felt deeply humbled by the thought
that I was so unworthy of the feelings my beloved father
entertained towards me: but I was fully aware that it was his
<i>own disposition</i> to cause him to feel as he did towards
me.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My amiable young friend and god-daughter also writes, in
reference to his kindness to servants:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page277"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
277</span>&ldquo;My dear father was the kindest and most
considerate of <span class="GutSmall">MASTERS</span>.&nbsp; He
was always anxious to promote the comfort and happiness of his
servants, and very careful not to wound their feelings, or to
give them unnecessary trouble or annoyance.&nbsp; He often
expressed his pleasure at seeing them seated by the fire at their
needlework, or enjoying the society of their relatives and
friends, and would tell them that he wished them to be as
comfortable as he was himself.&nbsp; Nor was he less mindful of
their spiritual welfare, and took pains to instruct them in the
great duties of religion.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the foregoing particulars, illustrative of my
friend&rsquo;s character as a Christian pastor, and in his
domestic relations, with the exception of a part of the article
on the character of his preaching, attributed in a note, to
another friend, I am entirely indebted to his youngest daughter,
Miss Phebe Mortimer: nothing is due to myself except for the
arrangement of the materials with which I have been so kindly and
so well furnished.</p>
<p>From the foregoing sketch, as well as from the general
contents of the volume, Mr. Mortimer&rsquo;s character is clearly
seen, and cannot fail to excite admiration:&mdash;let every
reader here add a prayer to be enabled to imitate as well as to
admire.&nbsp; That my friend was possessed of no peculiarities,
or of no defects, I do not affirm; but they were blended with so
much purity of motive, integrity of principle, and correctness of
conduct, that his general excellences were visible to all, his
peculiarities were known but to few.&nbsp; His <i>extreme
carefulness</i> in expenditure, and his&mdash;seemingly, at
least&mdash;<i>over anxiousness</i> to preserve unimpaired, if
not to increase, his fortune, led him to the adoption of some
measures, which by many of his friends were thought
questionable.&nbsp; It is, however, exceedingly difficult to
judge another in <a name="page278"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
278</span>this matter, or, indeed, to set up any precise and
universal standard by which to form a judgment in the case.&nbsp;
So many among the clergy, it is to be feared, err in the opposite
extreme, and so much reproach has been brought upon the Church
and the clerical character, by the want of a sufficient prudence
and economy in secular affairs, to prevent pecuniary
embarrassment, that the error of too much care is much to be
preferred to that of a want of it, where it is attended by such
counteracting properties as marked Mr. Mortimer&rsquo;s
management of his income.&nbsp; His systematic charity, his
cheerful and bountiful liberality, and his strict integrity, more
than balance any defective peculiarity in his secular
matters.</p>
<p>If I might venture to sum up Mr. Mortimer&rsquo;s character in
a few words, I should say that his whole life, from the time of
his becoming a decided Christian, was characterized by firm
faith, deep humility, great decision, steady consistency,
self-denial, holy zeal, and patient perseverance; and his manners
were characterized by urbanity, kindness, and sweetness of
address peculiar to himself.&nbsp; As a pastor, as a private
Christian, as a relative, and as a friend, he has left an example
worthy of imitation.&nbsp; &ldquo;Blessed are the dead which die
in the Lord: even so saith the Spirit; for they rest from their
labours, and their works do follow them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Mortimer, just before his death, gave directions to
destroy all his papers and writings, and it does not appear that
he kept any record of the events of his life, or of his Christian
experience: no specimen, therefore, of his regular composition
has come into the hands of the writer.&nbsp; The following
fragments or remains have been collected from different sources,
and show his opinions on the several subjects of them.</p>
<h3><a name="page279"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
279</span>ARMINIANISM.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Your</span> very Christian remarks and
feelings connected with my much honoured and much beloved
Wellington friend deserve my sincere thanks.&nbsp; You are quite
right: the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace is of
infinitely more importance than nice and subtle distinctions upon
points of which, after all, we know so exceedingly little.&nbsp;
I do not think those two sermons should have been attached to the
volumes, whose other contents are generally practical: and I
objected at the time, but the opinions of others prevailed.&nbsp;
I think with you that the text is unhappily chosen.&nbsp; As to
the contents, we shall of course differ: but I can say so much as
this, that I attach so little importance to the peculiarities of
the system which I adopt, that, for many months past, I have
declined <i>in toto</i> entering upon the subject with every one
who would dispute with me: and am so moderate in my own
statements, that most of my Arminian friends have their fears of
my eventually leaving them:&mdash;not that any alteration has
taken place in my doctrinal views, but simply in the ideas of
importance which I used at one time to attach to them.</p>
<h3>ATHANASIAN CREED.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Athanasian Creed is not the
milk which the Church gives to her babes, but the test to which
she brings her heretics.</p>
<h3>CATHOLIC EMANCIPATION.</h3>
<p>As to Catholic Emancipation I profess to know and to fear but
little.&nbsp; Were I better acquainted with the <a
name="page280"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 280</span>effects of
the present system, I fancy I should think with such men as Mr.
Wilberforce: but not knowing these, having only a very limited
survey, I feel quite satisfied to let them think for me.&nbsp; A
meeting was lately called at Bridgenorth to petition against the
claims.&nbsp; I refused both to attend and to authorize the use
of my signature.&nbsp; I am equally satisfied, however, that the
bill should be lost: and I should imagine that the strength in
the Upper House will always throw it out.</p>
<h3>DR. A. CLARKE&rsquo;S COMMENTARY.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">You</span> ask me my opinion of Dr. Adam
Clarke&rsquo;s Commentary.&nbsp; I think that upon the whole it
is a great work: and few persons could have produced such a
one.&nbsp; But after all, the Dr. is not to be depended on, he is
far too venturesome and far too positive&mdash;he drives through
thick and thin&mdash;certain opinions must be maintained, certain
characters must be vindicated, and this is done in a manner and
spirit which is not quite suited to my taste.&nbsp; I continue,
however, to take in the work for the present: but have told one
of the Methodist preachers stationed here, that, if he can part
with it for me on reasonable terms, I will take from him
Benson&rsquo;s Commentary in its stead.</p>
<h3>CLASSES.</h3>
<p>As to classes, I still think that something like church
fellowship is the grand desideratum of our Church.&nbsp; The
Communion, which was originally intended for this, now completely
fails.&nbsp; It is almost anything but the <i>communion of
saints</i>.&nbsp; Private meetings, too, of a familiar,
conversational, or expository kind, do not quite come up to the
supposed point.&nbsp; There must <a name="page281"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 281</span>be some enclosure&mdash;some hedge
of separation, something which shall admit the apparently sincere
inquirer and exclude the worldly&mdash;something, in fact, which
shall &ldquo;gather believers together out of the mass of the
ungodly world.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>DISSENT.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> reference to Dissent, I am, I
believe, what Dissenters consider a high, bigoted, stiff
Churchman, but the simple true Churchman is all I wish to be
known by.&nbsp; I love my Church right thoroughly, and I love
Church unity in the same degree, and have never, for many years
past, done anything by countenancing, encouraging, aiding, or
abetting Dissent, and I hope I never shall; but I cannot, dare
not, unchurch Dissenters, and deny that they are sections of
Christ&rsquo;s outward and visible Church, and, of course, I
cannot but respect the private characters and conduct of many
individuals among them.</p>
<h3>EPISCOPACY.</h3>
<p>As to Episcopacy, I think with Bishop Hall, that it is
necessary for the <i>well</i> or <i>better</i> being of a Church,
but not essentially necessary to its very being itself; and as to
High Church principles, or Puseyism, or Tractarian notions, I go
not a single step.&nbsp; I regard them as quite subversive of the
doctrine of Christ; there is not one single point, by which they
are distinguished but, if honestly carried out, must lead to
Romanism.&nbsp; Admit, for example, that in ordination there is
conveyed through the bishop, of necessity, and independent of the
state of mind of the candidate, any grace or virtue or
qualification for the spiritually and graciously discharging the
duties of the <a name="page282"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
282</span>ministerial office, which is not conveyed by
Presbyterian or Methodistical ordination, and you arrogate for
our Church what neither Scripture on the one hand, nor daily
observation on the other, will substantiate.&nbsp; They may
authorize and commission those who appear to them already
qualified, but it is the Divine Spirit alone, which can fit and
qualify with all the gifts and graces necessary for a due
discharge of their important function.</p>
<h3>FAITH AND WORKS.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> a man is justified by faith,
he is by faith accounted just and righteous <i>before</i>
God.</p>
<p>When a man is justified by works, he is by his works
proclaimed or declared <i>to man</i> to be just and
righteous.</p>
<p>To be justified is generally to be considered or regarded just
or righteous.</p>
<h3>FIRST STEP.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> first step in vital religion is
a sense of the presence of God.</p>
<h3>FRIENDSHIP.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> generally happens when there are
little unpleasantnesses among friends and relations, that they
arise from mutual faults, and therefore I cannot but conclude,
that there must have been something either in my observations or
manner, which it would have been better to avoid.&nbsp; I am
surprised, however, that you should so long have suffered from
such incidents: friends, and especially relatives, should be <a
name="page283"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 283</span>like two
bowls suffering temporary collision; they should rub and go on,
for in this imperfect state we must expect many such a rub; we
cannot move at equal rates, we cannot keep at equal distances,
there will be an infringing every now and then, but still let us
go on, go on in love, agree to differ, and expect occasionally to
feel; but why should this feeling be either strong or
lasting?&nbsp; I am glad, however, that you have relieved your
mind, and though it has been a little at my expense, yet as the
effort has been beneficial to you, I will not attempt in any way
to destroy the effect, but will, for the sake of good will and
kind feeling, admit anything you have said.&nbsp; And here may
such matters rest &ldquo;never to rise again.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>MILLENNIUM.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the Millennial question, I am
always backward to speak; for I expect no personal reign: look
for nothing very immediate, and then merely suppose a general or
universal profession of Christianity throughout the world, and
deeper work in the hearts of believers.&nbsp; As to the time of
previous trial, I dare hazard but little&mdash;in sober truth, I
do not suffer myself to be puzzled, or even much occupied with
<i>unfulfilled</i> prophecy; with this we have graciously little
to do; it is purposely so revealed that it cannot be previously
known, that it may not seem, when accomplished, to have been
through its prediction fulfilled.</p>
<h3>SIR ISAAC NEWTON.<br />
(<i>From the Rev. T. Grinfield</i>.)</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Mortimer</span> had a fine mind for
mathematical studies, and took a high degree in the Senate House
<a name="page284"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
284</span>Examination of 1811.&nbsp; I have often questioned him
on topics connected with those studies;&mdash;and well remember
asking him, on one occasion, what he supposed might be the reason
why <span class="smcap">Newton</span>, with so vast a mind for
mathematical science, and after such unprecedented success,
should have deserted all further investigations of that kind
during the latter thirty years of his studious life.&nbsp; With
his characteristic sagacity, he promptly assigned a reason which
has not (that I know) been remarked by Sir D. Brewster, or the
other biographers of <span class="smcap">Newton</span>, and
which, while it exempts him from the unjust imputation of an
enfeebled mind, does just honour to his piety, and may probably
be the real, deep, and admonitory reason: &ldquo;Ah, sir, we must
remember that, great as he was in intellect, after all <span
class="smcap">Newton</span> was but a man, who had the same
<i>wants and cravings of the heart</i> with ourselves.&nbsp;
Having achieved his great discoveries, he began to feel within
himself, <i>this also is vanity</i>: he could not find, in his
mathematical demonstrations, <i>rest for his
soul</i>&mdash;<i>satisfaction</i> for his <i>heart</i>, he
therefore turned his attention from science to the
<i>Scriptures</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; I thought the explanation at once
original and just, and, as it refers to &ldquo;Magnum illum,
<span class="smcap">Newtonum</span>, qui genus humanum ingenio
superavit,&rdquo; <a name="citation284"></a><a
href="#footnote284" class="citation">[284]</a> singularly
interesting and impressive:&mdash;a fragment, among many
reminiscences, that I would fain preserve from being lost.</p>
<h3>BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH&rsquo;S EIGHTY-SEVEN QUESTIONS.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Bishop of Peterborough, in my
opinion, richly deserves all he has met with; and I do hope that
since many, perhaps a majority of our bishops, read <a
name="page285"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 285</span>the
<i>Christian Observer</i> the rough handling he has experienced
will operate beneficially on the bench at large.&nbsp; From my
heart I hate and detest all inquisitorial measures.&nbsp;
Perhaps, however, the Evangelical body need some fan or other to
purge the floor; and though a great stir has lately been made
about oppression &amp;c., I am not without hope that it will do
us considerable good.</p>
<h3>SUBJECTS FOR PRAYER.</h3>
<p>I.&nbsp; That we may habitually realize a <i>sense of the
Divine presence</i>.</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; That we may live in the will of God, and feel that
it is <i>precious</i> to us.</p>
<p>III.&nbsp; That we may be <i>grateful</i>
Christians&mdash;<i>trace</i> our mercies&mdash;and thankfully
adore the good Lord for sending them.</p>
<p>IV.&nbsp; That we may be helped against the soul-ruining, and
God-dishonouring sin of <i>unbelief</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lord,
increase our faith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>V.&nbsp; That our confidence may be strengthened as connected
with prayer in general, and especially in these private
addresses.</p>
<p>VI.&nbsp; That we may discover in all our enjoyments, social
intercourse, &amp;c. &amp;c. <i>true sobriety of mind</i>, and
guard against every approach to a <i>light</i> and <i>frivolous
spirit</i>.</p>
<p>VII.&nbsp; That we may manifest a spirit of faithful
admonition and reproof, combined with tenderness.</p>
<p>VIII.&nbsp; For earnestness in the cause of God.</p>
<p>IX.&nbsp; For those gifts and graces implied in the outpouring
of God&rsquo;s Spirit.</p>
<p>X.&nbsp; For a discovery of the love of Jesus, and a greater
knowledge of him in all his saving benefits&mdash;wisdom,
righteousness, and strength.</p>
<p>XI.&nbsp; For growth in grace in general, and in its <a
name="page286"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
286</span>evidences.&nbsp; 1st. Increased love to the
Saviour.&nbsp; 2nd. Increased hatred to sin; and 3d.&nbsp;
Increasingly lowly views of ourselves.</p>
<h3>SACRAMENTAL GRACE.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">With</span> regard to sacramental grace, I
do not conceive that an episcopally ordained minister has any
inherent grace deposited in him, which imparts a greater
efficacy, when a sacrament is administered by him, above what may
be received by graciously prepared recipients, who may have it
administered by others not episcopally ordained.&nbsp; The good
imparted is immediately and directly from the Divine Spirit, just
as the power of seeing came immediately and directly from Christ,
and not through the clay with which the eyes of the blind man
were anointed: no inherent or even transferred power with which
the clay had become endowed, but a simple transaction between
Christ and the believing applicant.&nbsp; The outward and visible
signs are of great importance, but most lamentable is it when
they are invested with that power which belongs to God
alone.&nbsp; The connexion between these views and Romanism is
easily apparent.&nbsp; Salvation is no longer of faith, but of
works:&mdash;use forms, ceremonies, penances, sacraments,
prayers, recitations, liturgical services, and all is done: grace
is conveyed, and that, too, in proportion to the number and
frequency of the performances; and the state of the heart all the
while disregarded&mdash;the vast surplusage of merit will be
obtained, or extreme unction adjust all.</p>
<h3><a name="page287"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 287</span>THE
SACRAMENTS. <a name="citation287a"></a><a href="#footnote287a"
class="citation">[287a]</a></h3>
<p>1.&nbsp; What are the Sacraments? <a
name="citation287b"></a><a href="#footnote287b"
class="citation">[287b]</a></p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;They are outward and visible signs and
pledges of inward and spiritual grace.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Ch.
Cat.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>2.&nbsp; How many are the Christian Sacraments?</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There are (only) two Sacraments ordained by
Christ our Lord in the Gospel: that is to say, Baptism and the
Supper of the Lord.&rdquo;&mdash;25<i>th</i> <i>Art. Ch. of
England</i>. <a name="citation287c"></a><a href="#footnote287c"
class="citation">[287c]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>3.&nbsp; What are the design and use of Sacraments?</p>
<p class="gutindent">The principal design is to convey
&ldquo;spiritual grace&rdquo; to the soul: and their chief use
consists in their being suitable &ldquo;means&rdquo; for the
purpose.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; What is the nature of the Christian Sacraments?</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only
badges or tokens of Christian men&rsquo;s profession, but rather
they be certain sure witnesses, and effectual signs of grace, and
God&rsquo;s good will towards us, by the which he doth work
invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also strengthen
and confirm our faith in Him.&rdquo;&mdash;25<i>th</i> <i>Art.
Ch. of England</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>5.&nbsp; What do you understand by &ldquo;spiritual
grace,&rdquo; which you say it is the design of the Sacraments to
convey to the soul?</p>
<p class="gutindent">The term grace has many significations in
Scripture: <a name="page288"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
288</span>but most commonly it either means good-will, or favour
(Romans xi. 6; 2 Tim. i. 9; Rom. v. 20); or it signifies the
<i>internal operation of the Holy Spirit</i> upon the soul,
regenerating, purifying, and sanctifying our nature: and the
Sacraments, when duly regarded, are signs and pledges of the one,
and effectual means of conveying the other.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; How, then, are the Sacraments to be regarded?</p>
<p class="gutindent">Simply as <i>means</i> of grace, and not as
<i>necessarily</i> conveying any internal benefit to the soul:
for no such benefit is, or can be, derived from them, unless the
mind be previously prepared to partake of them as God has willed
and commanded.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; What proofs can you adduce that the internal benefits
of Sacraments are not absolute, and independent of the previous
state of the mind?</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>First</i>, because we have no warrant
either in Scripture, or in the reason of things, to think so;
and, <i>secondly</i>, because, if they were so, no one could eat
and drink in the Lord&rsquo;s Supper to their own condemnation,
which St. Paul affirms is the case with those who eat and drink
unworthily.&nbsp; (1. Cor. xi. 29.&nbsp; Acts viii. 13,
20&ndash;23.)</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; But though this is the case in the Lord&rsquo;s
Supper, are not the benefits of Baptism absolute and
unconditional?</p>
<p class="gutindent">No: repentance and faith in our Lord Jesus
Christ are indispensably necessary in all cases previously to any
<i>saving</i> benefits being derived from the use of this
sacrament.&nbsp; Repentance and faith, however, though previously
necessary, are in nowise the <i>meritorious</i> and
<i>procuring</i> cause of these benefits; they form only a
preparatory and necessary meetness for a due reception of
them.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp; But are not infants, although incapable of either
repentance or faith, invariably regenerated, renewed, and
sanctified in and by this sacrament?</p>
<p class="gutindent">All that are baptized are said to be
regenerated, <a name="page289"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
289</span>because the outward ordinance is a sign or emblem of
&ldquo;spiritual regeneration.&rdquo;&nbsp; And nothing is more
common, both in Scripture and in ancient writings, than the use
of a term which only denotes the <i>sign</i> for the <i>thing
signified</i>.&nbsp; And in the judgment of Christian charity, in
all cases when this sacrament is rightly received, and the after
conduct corresponds with the professions therein made, we may
conclude that they partake, as of the sign, so also of the thing
signified.</p>
<p>10.&nbsp; What do you understand by the sacrament being
&ldquo;rightly received&rdquo;?</p>
<p class="gutindent">The sacrament is rightly received in infant
baptism, when the parents and sponsors have just scriptural views
of its nature and design, and present children to be baptized in
obedience to the authority of God; simply, humbly, and sincerely
depending upon his unmerited grace and favour in Christ Jesus;
and are truly desirous that the child so presented by them, may
become &ldquo;the faithful soldier and servant of the Lord Jesus
Christ;&rdquo; and when the sponsors themselves exercise
repentance, whereby &ldquo;they forsake sin, and faith, whereby
they stedfastly believe the promises of God made to them in that
sacrament.&rdquo;&nbsp; In all such cases we have &ldquo;a
presumptive certainty&rdquo; that spiritual regeneration
commences in the ordinance; for then it is &ldquo;<i>rightly
received</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>11.&nbsp; What is the best <i>after</i> proof of this?</p>
<p class="gutindent">The best after proof which children can give
of this is, the fulfilment of those promises and engagements made
for them by their sponsors in their baptism.</p>
<p>12.&nbsp; And what were the promises and engagements?</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;That they should renounce the devil and all
his works, the pomps and vanity of this wicked world, and all the
sinful lusts of the flesh; that they should believe all the
articles of the Christian <a name="page290"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 290</span>faith; and that they should keep
God&rsquo;s holy will and commandments, and walk in the same all
the days of their life.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Ch. Cat.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>13.&nbsp; But how do you show that children in after life are
bound to fulfil those engagements made for them by others, at
this unconscious period of their infancy?</p>
<p class="gutindent">They are bound to do so by the obligation
which they themselves owe to God, inasmuch as their parents or
spiritual guardians entered into such engagements only, on their
behalf, as each individual is bound to fulfil, whether such
engagements had or had not been entered into by others.</p>
<h3>TEMPERANCE.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Public</span> opinion is, through
God&rsquo;s mercy, effecting much among us.&nbsp; Much
bitterness, indeed, still exists in some, as well as most
determined opposition.&nbsp; But the work is of God, and I feel a
blessed assurance that much good will eventually be done.&nbsp; I
am beginning to perceive with much thankfulness that the
Temperance Society is an important engine in aid of all my
ministerial plans&mdash;a kind of stepping stone to the church
and to piety; and I am careful to watch all its movements, and to
follow up every indication for good.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following letter, addressed to
the Rev. John Cooper, it is presumed may not unsuitably close the
preceding Memoir.&nbsp; The writer, who so affectionately
expresses his deep obligations to the late Mr. Mortimer, has been
for many years the faithful minister <a name="page291"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 291</span>of a large parish in Shropshire,
very near the scene of Mr. M.&rsquo;s former labours in that
county.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">W&mdash; Vicarage, June 18,
1845.</p>
<p>My dear Friend,</p>
<p>I <span class="smcap">feel</span> sincerely and deeply obliged
to you for the kindness you have shown in sending me the
interesting extracts you have made from Miss Mortimer&rsquo;s
letter, relative to her beloved father.&nbsp; There are few, if
any, to whom I am so deeply indebted as I am to that dear and
valued friend.&nbsp; At an early period of my life he noticed me
with a kindness and humility which I can never forget.&nbsp;
These were, indeed, traits constantly exhibited in his Christian
character, but they were the more affecting and attractive as
appearing in a man of such ability and accomplishments.&nbsp;
Whatever I know of Christian truth and experience I owe in a high
degree to the daily conversations which I was permitted to enjoy
for many months in three or four successive years, with him, and
to the sermons and expositions which I heard from him at that
time, every Sabbath and every week.</p>
<p>After I left Madeley I saw less of him, though our intercourse
was renewed, in some measure, when he came to Bristol, and, in
the end, he succeeded me in my old curacy at Hutton, on my
presentation to the living which I now hold. * * * Not many
letters ever passed between us; but <i>I have never ceased to
remember him with admiration</i>, <i>gratitude</i>, <i>and
love</i>.&nbsp; <i>Indeed</i>, <i>take him altogether</i>, <i>and
I have never seen his equal</i>.</p>
<p>With my very kind regards to yourself and family,</p>

</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> receiving an invitation to
officiate on the mournful occasion which calls us together,
accompanied with a request that I would also preach a sermon
suitable to the afflicting circumstance, the oft-repeated
encouragement of my dear departed friend, eagerly to embrace
every opportunity of setting forth Christ, was brought home to my
mind, and a voice from the dead seemed to say, Stand in my
accustomed place, and for me tell to my bereaved family and
friends, to the people of my charge and of my many prayers, that
the Gospel which they have so often heard proclaimed by the lips
now cold in death, is not a vague uncertainty, but the power of
God unto salvation; and while they weep for one whose most
earnest endeavours were to promote their welfare, that they
should not sorrow as those without hope, but seek earnestly to
become imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit
the promises.</p>
<p>So suddenly was he whose loss we mourn taken from the midst of
us, that the necessity and duty of watchfulness naturally
presents itself to the mind; <a name="page296"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 296</span>such is the injunction implied in
the words of my text&mdash;to <i>that</i> and the <i>blessing</i>
promised let us first direct our attention.</p>
<p>Under the figure of a householder, or master, and his
servants, Christ represents Himself, and those who profess to be
His disciples; for it is evident that the words are addressed to
such, and not to the godless and profane.&nbsp; And as
Christ&rsquo;s <i>watching</i> servants are also to be
<i>working</i> servants, fidelity, diligence, and perseverance
the Lord requires to find in them, when he comes to call them to
their account.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is required in stewards that a man be found
faithful,&rdquo; saith St. Paul.&nbsp; No other qualification can
compensate for the want of this, and the higher the trust
reposed, the greater is the fidelity required.&nbsp; How solemn,
then, and awful, is the position of the minister of Christ! he
has not only to watch for his own soul, and take care lest his
very duties, by their frequent performance, become the means of
imperceptibly leading him to trust in them, and think that
because he is made useful to others, it must, therefore, be well
with himself, but also to watch for the souls of others.&nbsp; As
Christ&rsquo;s ambassador, there is committed unto him the
ministry of reconciliation, to entreat sinners in Christ&rsquo;s
stead to be reconciled to God; and should any perish through his
wilful neglect, either to warn or to give instruction, against
the unfaithful minister is denounced the fearful sentence,
&ldquo;his blood will I require at thy hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Deeply did our beloved friend feel this; his daily prayer and
study was to make full proof of his ministry, and seek by every
means to win souls to Christ.&nbsp; His manner of life from the
time of his first coming among you, up to the hour of his death,
is known to most present.&nbsp; In his family the kind husband,
parent, and master, anxious for the comfort <a
name="page297"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 297</span>and welfare
of all, yet most anxious that each who dwelt beneath his roof,
might love that Saviour who was so precious to his own
soul.&nbsp; Owing to the delicate state of his health, and what
he suffered from even a little unusual excitement, he was,
perhaps, seen less in his family than most clergymen; but those
friends with whom he felt that he could act freely, and leave
when he found himself no longer equal to conversation, will
doubtless bear me witness, that as the head of a family few
excelled him, and that it was a happy privilege to join with him
at the family altar in prayer and praise.</p>
<p>In the temporal property which God had given him, we find the
same earnest care that God might be glorified thereby.&nbsp; His
liberality is well known, and the principle on which he acted, he
believed to be in accordance to God&rsquo;s revealed word.&nbsp;
At first, a tenth of his property was set apart, and after a
little while, not feeling satisfied with that portion, one
seventh of his income, as he received it, was regularly set
apart, and most carefully used, as might best promote the glory
of God, and the good of his fellow-creatures.&nbsp; All he
possessed he considered as a talent given by God with the
injunction, &ldquo;Occupy till I come,&rdquo; and as a good
steward he laboured faithfully to improve the talent committed to
his trust.</p>
<p>But the fulfilment of his ministerial duties was that which
engaged his most earnest attention.</p>
<p>He would not offer to the Lord that which cost him nothing,
and whether his sermons were what is commonly termed extempore,
or written, they were composed with much care, and after much
prayer.&nbsp; His anxiety was to win souls to Christ, and to give
to each his portion of meat in due season; he was careful, almost
to a fault, that the subject on which he was treating should be
rightly divided.</p>
<p><a name="page298"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 298</span>But
his greatest delight <a name="citation298"></a><a
href="#footnote298" class="citation">[298]</a> appeared to be in
visiting his people from house to house, warning the wicked of
the danger of his ways, encouraging the weak, comforting the
feeble minded, but more especially delighting to dwell upon that
theme so dear to his own soul, the love of Christ.&nbsp; As a
father with his children, they were all upon his heart, and few
days were suffered to elapse in which he did not visit some
families, and his visits were literally ministerial ones, as many
present can testify, and who will do well to treasure carefully
the instructions they have received, and pray earnestly that they
may be profitable to their souls.&nbsp; Judging by the test which
Christ himself hath given us, &ldquo;By their fruits ye shall
know them,&rdquo; will it not be the testimony of all who knew
our dear departed brother, that he was in the highest sense of
the term a faithful minister of God? and doubtless he has heard
from that Master whom he loved and served, &ldquo;Well done, good
and faithful servant, enter thou into the joy of thy
Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he was not only faithful but diligent.&nbsp; It is well
known that the strength of our friend was small, and that he was
afflicted with a nervous affection, the natural tendency of which
is to prostrate the energies both of mind and body.&nbsp; He felt
this and struggled against it, and frequently would return to his
house completely exhausted.&nbsp; With him there was no
&ldquo;spare thyself;&rdquo; whatsoever his hand found to do, he
did it with all his might, and as a good servant, his aim and
endeavour were to make the most of that strength which was given
him.</p>
<p>Patience and perseverance also are necessary <a
name="page299"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
299</span>qualifications for the Christian minister.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ye have need of patience,&rdquo; saith the Apostle St.
Paul, &ldquo;that after ye have done the will of God, ye might
receive the promise.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Add therefore,&rdquo;
saith St. Peter, &ldquo;to your faith, virtue; and to virtue,
knowledge; and to knowledge, temperance; and to temperance,
<i>patience</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;In your patience,&rdquo;
saith Christ, &ldquo;possess ye your souls.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
because his difficulties are great, and the enemies with which he
has to contend, numerous and powerful, he must put on the whole
armour of God, in order to withstand the evil day, and having
done all to stand.&nbsp; He must not only pray, but pray with all
prayer and supplication in the spirit; he must not only watch,
but watch with all <i>perseverance</i>.&nbsp; May it not, alas!
be said of some, that they began well, but lacked patience to run
the race that was set before them; as St. Paul complains of the
Galatians (chap. v. 5), <i>Ye did run well</i>, and yet
afterwards they made shipwreck of faith.&nbsp; The young
Christian, when he feels himself as a brand plucked out of the
burning, and experiences the love of Christ in his soul,
constraining him to devote all his powers to the service of that
God who called him out of darkness into marvellous light, like
Peter, is ready to combat a host of men in his Master&rsquo;s
defence, wonders at his former blindness, and almost thinks it
strange, that any should neglect the service of so good a
Master.&nbsp; And in like manner the young minister, when first
appointed to his charge, and opening his commission as one of
God&rsquo;s ambassadors, like the untried soldier, thinks of
great things to be achieved, and the difficulties seem light; but
by degrees both find that the course cannot be run without many a
struggle, nor the victory won without many a battle.&nbsp; And
the minister of Christ more than any other, will be assaulted by
the great adversary of souls with temptations exactly suited to
his circumstances and disposition, and all tending to one <a
name="page300"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 300</span>point, the
making Christ, and Christ crucified, if I may so state it, a
secondary object in his ministrations, first in name, second in
reality, giving to other duties and doctrines, valuable in
themselves and in their proper place, that pre-eminence which
belongs to Christ alone.&nbsp; Alas! my brethren, do we not see
too much of this in the present day!&nbsp; Bread is asked for,
and a stone is given by some who once preached &ldquo;Christ in
everything, and everything in Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; But we can
thankfully bear testimony to the perseverance of our dear
departed brother in the right way; from the day of his admission
into the sacred office of the ministry up to the hour of his
removal from us, he looked unto Jesus, as the author and finisher
of his faith, set Him always before him, and with deep humility
sought to follow in his steps.</p>
<p>He was ordained in the year 1811, and for many years
officiated in the parish of Madeley, England, and the testimony
of those who knew him there is, that he was systematic in all his
plans, which were laid after much consideration and prayer, and
then as earnestly carried out.&nbsp; For eleven years and a half
he was your minister, part of which time he was unable to perform
any active duties from weakness, and a violent nervous affection
which seized him when the Bishop of Toronto visited this place,
to consecrate the church and confirm the young.&nbsp; It was to
him a severe trial to be laid aside, as he used to express
himself, as of no more use, and yet with cheerful humility he
would often observe, &ldquo;The Lord&rsquo;s work can go on
without me,&rdquo; or words to that effect.&nbsp; But contrary to
his own expectation and that of his friends, he was again
restored to comparative health and strength, and oh, how eagerly
did he resume his duties directly he felt himself equal to them,
and his gratitude to God was great for enabling him again to set
forth Christ!</p>
<p>Joined to fidelity, diligence, and perseverance, was <a
name="page301"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 301</span>continual
watchfulness.&nbsp; He waited for the Lord&rsquo;s coming, he
watched unto prayer, as one who was to give an account.&nbsp; The
exhortation of the prophet Ezekiel (iii. 17), &ldquo;Son of man,
I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel,&rdquo; was
deeply impressed upon his mind, and every means in his power he
used to win souls to Christ.&nbsp; He watched over the young of
his flock with a father&rsquo;s love and a father&rsquo;s
anxiety, and many present can testify to the affectionate
kindness with which he received them in little parties to explain
and enforce the precepts of the Gospel.&nbsp; In visiting his
people he was watchful to speak a word in season, making it, I
believe, a rule never, or very rarely, to leave a house or family
without speaking of the one thing needful.&nbsp; Ever remembering
that the vows of God were upon him, he was studiously careful
that even in manner he might act as became a minister of God,
whilst at the same time few were more cheerful than
himself.&nbsp; His pulpit preparations were also subjects of much
anxious watchfulness and prayer: he studied what he conceived to
be his people&rsquo;s wants, and in love endeavoured to declare
to them the whole counsel of God.</p>
<p>And whilst watchful over those committed to his charge he was
not unmindful of that solemn hour which has come upon him.&nbsp;
For some time previous to his death, he seemed to have the
subject continually present to his mind, and would frequently
observe to the servant who drove him, on returning from his
accustomed rides, &ldquo;Once more the Lord has brought us home
in safety;&rdquo; and particularly during the last week his
conversation at every house he visited, was on death, and the
necessity of a constant state of preparation for it, warning the
careless, and entreating the almost Christian to come out from an
ungodly world, and so to live as to be accounted worthy to stand
before the Son of Man, when he shall come to judge the world in
righteousness.</p>
<p><a name="page302"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 302</span>A few
days since he observed to his servant, &ldquo;I shall not be long
here,&rdquo; and mentioned with satisfaction that the house was
his private property, and that Mrs. Mortimer would not have to
leave it, as she must have done had it been a parsonage.&nbsp;
These remarks were made when his bodily health appeared to be
improving, and, humanly speaking, there was every probability of
his being spared many years; and it is satisfactory to dwell on
these minute particulars now, as they give us the most certain
evidence that the sudden call to render up the account of his
stewardship found him ready and watchful for the summons.</p>
<p>Our beloved friend was found watching, and the blessing
promised is his portion; he received the earnest of it in this
world, he doubtless enjoys it more fully now.</p>
<p>He was blessed in the enjoyment, in no small degree, of the
confidence and affection of his people; he was looked up to as a
father and a friend, and the outward demonstrations of respect
and sorrow which appear on every side this day prove that the
loss is felt to be no common one, and many are ready to exclaim,
&ldquo;My father! my father! the chariot of Israel and the
horsemen thereof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was blessed in being permitted to see that his labours were
not in vain in the Lord.&nbsp; Whilst we would by no means lay
down ministerial success as the certain token of God&rsquo;s
favour, or the want of it a mark of his displeasure&mdash;for
sometimes the most faithful devoted ministers are only permitted
to sow the seed, while others reap the harvest, in order
practically to prove to us that it is not by human might or
power, but by the Spirit of God alone, that souls can be
converted to Him; that a Paul may plant, and Apollos water, but
it is God alone who giveth the increase&mdash;yet it is a
blessing, and a great and precious one, to be permitted to see
the work of <a name="page303"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
303</span>the Lord prospering in our hands.&nbsp; Little,
perhaps, do some present think of the anxious hopes and fears
which fill the minister&rsquo;s heart while preparing for his
public ministrations, or striving to bring before his people the
whole counsel of God.&nbsp; How often in the bitterness of
disappointed hope he is ready to exclaim, &ldquo;Who hath
believed our report?&rdquo;&nbsp; But when he marks the earnest
attention paid to his ministrations, the vanities of the world
forsaken by some, who boldly, and yet with humility declare,
Whatever be the conduct of others, &ldquo;as for me and my house
we will serve the Lord;&rdquo; great is his encouragement, and he
goeth on his way rejoicing.&nbsp; This blessing was vouchsafed to
our dear departed friend, and he was also permitted to see that
his ministrations were so highly valued that the church in which
we are now assembled required twice to be enlarged to accommodate
the increasing congregation.</p>
<p>There is something painful in the thought that so good a man
should be thus suddenly, and in such a manner, taken from the
midst of us.&nbsp; We should have chosen for him a long and
peaceful old age, and when, at length, he must depart this life,
like corn fully ripe, the Master whom he loved and served would
come and gently receive him to himself.&nbsp; But his death and
the manner of it was appointed by One wiser than man, and who
loved him better than his dearest earthly friends.&nbsp; Even in
his sudden death, there was a blessing and an answer to many
prayers.&nbsp; From the state of his bodily health, and what he
had previously suffered, he used to dread the pains of dying, and
earnestly prayed that he might either be spared these pains, or
be strengthened under them.&nbsp; And God gave him more than he
asked; for nearly two years past this dread was taken away, and
the bodily pain he suffered after the accident, was, I have been
informed, not equal <a name="page304"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 304</span>to the uneasy sensations experienced
at fainting.&nbsp; At first, he did not consider that he had
received a fatal injury, and on being taken up, exclaimed,
&ldquo;He keepeth all my bones, not one of them is
broken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His kind friend and physician Dr. Paget, hastened to his
assistance, and brought him gently home.&nbsp; The family,
naturally much alarmed, eagerly met him as he was being carried
into the house, anxious to ascertain the extent of the injury; he
strove to calm their fears by telling them, what he then really
thought, that he was not seriously hurt.&nbsp; But when laid upon
his bed, and he found, as he expressed it, that it would be
instant death for him to lie in any but the one position, then he
felt that he should never rise again, and was thankful for being
brought home to his own comfortable bed.&nbsp; He then spoke with
much feeling of the kindness and gentleness of the persons who
took him up immediately after the accident, repeating,
&ldquo;Kind&mdash;kind,&rdquo; and expressed himself as quite
resigned to the will of God, not anxious to live, and ready to
die.&nbsp; He alluded briefly to his temporal affairs, and when
he felt his end approaching, desired that those who were not
present might be called, when he addressed a few words separately
to each, ending with &ldquo;<i>God bless you</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
was evidently an effort for him to speak much, and his memory
appeared to be in some degree affected, as he mentioned none of
the family who were absent, and only addressed those present as
they stood directly before him.&nbsp; Having spoken to his
family, he then prayed for his people; they had always been very
dear to him, and often had his prayers ascended before the throne
of grace on their behalf, and now, ere the spirit took its
flight, whilst yet he might plead for a blessing to descend upon
them, he lifted up his heart with the words, &ldquo;God bless my
poor dear people;&rdquo; and having uttered this prayer, he lay
for a time quite still, and then so gently fell asleep <a
name="page305"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 305</span>in Jesus,
that an old and valued servant of the family observed, &ldquo;How
sweetly master is sleeping!&rdquo; and knew not that it was death
until told by the physician, &ldquo;It is the sleep of
death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was permitted to retain his senses to the last, having
lived about four hours after the accident.</p>
<p>Beloved friends, may the dying prayers of your late valued
minister be heard and answered abundantly on your behalf!&nbsp;
&ldquo;Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord, even so, saith
the Spirit, for they rest from their labours.&rdquo;&nbsp; Our
departed friend has fought the good fight, has finished his
course, and entered into his rest.&nbsp; He now beholds Him whom
having not seen he loved.&nbsp; Oh that those who are ready to
exclaim &ldquo;Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my
last end be like his,&rdquo; may treasure up the instruction they
have received from him they will see no more, till all meet at
the judgment-seat of Christ, and seek to follow in the steps of
their departed minister as he followed Christ.</p>
<p>We observe from what has been stated, that even in death he
was greatly blessed, but what is that compared with the blessing
he is now inheriting!&nbsp; We weep around his lifeless corpse,
but his freed spirit rejoices in the presence of its God.&nbsp;
Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither hath it entered into
the heart of man to conceive the things which God hath prepared
for them that love him: and in a little time, that which was a
weak and fragile body whilst animated by the spirit, and now
about to turn to corruption, shall rise a glorious body; it is
sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption; it is sown in
dishonour and shall be raised in glory.&nbsp; Our departed friend
looked forward to this when more than once he exclaimed, a little
before he closed his eyes in death, &ldquo;I am going to my
rest,&rdquo; not yet to the fulness of bliss.&nbsp; It doth not
yet appear what we shall be, man cannot describe it; raise the
imagination <a name="page306"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
306</span>to the highest pitch, and still it will fall far short
of the reality; for &ldquo;when He shall appear, we shall be like
Him, for we shall see Him as He is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From this subject let us seek to derive some practical
improvement.</p>
<p>1st.&nbsp; A solemn warning.&nbsp; The words of my text are
addressed by Christ through his servant to each present, and the
scene before us proves that in such an hour as we think not, the
Son of man cometh.&nbsp; Who would have thought a few days since,
that we should have been assembled here on this occasion, or that
your minister, whose renewed strength seemed to promise many
years of usefulness, would have been thus cut off suddenly as in
a moment?&nbsp; Oh, my brethren, you well know that he taught you
long and faithfully, ever willing to spend and be spent in your
service.&nbsp; You must meet him at the judgment-seat of Christ,
and how will you answer it if you then be found unprofitable
servants, and he who loved and served you here, and was honoured
and loved by you in return, be obliged to testify against you,
that he entreated you in Christ&rsquo;s stead to be reconciled to
God, and you refused?&nbsp; May the awful words which are written
in the forty-seventh verse of the chapter from whence my text is
taken, awaken each of you to greater diligence, since the servant
which knew his Lord&rsquo;s will, and prepared not himself,
neither did according to that will, shall be beaten with many
stripes.</p>
<p>2nd.&nbsp; Submission to God&rsquo;s will.&nbsp; Be still and
know that I am God, and this not of necessity, because we
<i>must</i> submit, but pray and labour that though sorrowful we
may yet be rejoicing, since we sorrow not as those without hope,
that this affliction may produce a lasting blessing.&nbsp; Thus
Eli submitted when the message from the Lord declared such heavy
tidings against him and against his family, saying, &ldquo;It is
the Lord, let him do what seemeth him good.&rdquo;&nbsp; <a
name="page307"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 307</span>And thus
holy Job, when his property was lost, all his children taken, and
his body afflicted with sore boils, from the sole of his foot to
the crown of his head, and his very wife urging him to curse God
and die&mdash;&ldquo;Shall we receive good at the hand of the
Lord, and shall we not receive evil?&nbsp; The Lord gave and the
Lord hath taken away, blessed be the name of the Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>3rd.&nbsp; Encouragement.&nbsp; We remember the gifts and
graces of our departed friend; but from whence were they
derived?&nbsp; What made him what he was?&nbsp; The Lord.&nbsp;
And who supported him all his journey through life?&nbsp; It was
the same God.&nbsp; He found the grace of God sufficient for him,
and the feeling of his heart at all times was, &ldquo;not unto
us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto Thy name be the
glory.&rdquo;&nbsp; The God who called, guided, supported, and
blessed our departed friend, is still the same.&nbsp; His arm is
not shortened, nor his ear heavy, and His direction to us is, ask
and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.&nbsp; We may
therefore derive also</p>
<p>4th.&nbsp; Comfort.&nbsp; Doubtless our friend hath entered
into the presence of the Lord, and the meanest redeemed sinner
will sing a louder song of triumph than the highest
archangel.&nbsp; Angels have never tasted of pardoning grace and
redeeming love.&nbsp; Did you love your minister?&nbsp; Then
thank God that he is released from all sorrow and trial.&nbsp;
Thank God for what he has promised, that, having preserved your
minister to the end, He will, if you seek Him, also preserve
you.</p>
<p>My reverend brethren, in this bereavement, there is a message
from God sent to us, as watchmen of the House of Israel.&nbsp;
One is taken from our midst, and we are left exposed to peculiar
trials and temptations.&nbsp; Our brother was the same, and he
continued faithful to the end.&nbsp; And what was his strength
and comfort?&nbsp; It was Christ.&nbsp; Oh let us beware of
preaching <a name="page308"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
308</span>anything but Christ crucified, as &ldquo;the way, the
truth, and the life&rdquo; for perishing sinners.&nbsp; The more
we seek and exalt Him, the more shall we feel in our happy
experience, &ldquo;Christ all and in all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In conclusion, let me remind this congregation that your late
minister&rsquo;s instructions are yet sounding in your
ears.&nbsp; Oh take heed to them.&nbsp; Pray that the Holy Spirit
may be to you a spirit of remembrance, bringing again to your
minds what has been said to you; and as you pass the mound of
earth which covers his mortal remains, strive to call to mind
what he said while yet with you, and seek the grace of God to
enable you so to live that you may become followers of those who,
through faith and patience, inherit the promises.&nbsp; Amen.</p>

<blockquote><p>. . . &ldquo;Dr. Cheever&rsquo;s sketches are so
vivid, and so true, at the same time, to the spirit of Bunyan,
that we have passed on from Lecture to Lecture without feeling,
in a single instance, that either the poetry or the theology of
the Pilgrim has been dissipated.&nbsp; Indeed, we cannot withhold
our strongly cherished conviction, that our American brother has
better caught the feeling of the Pilgrim, and better transfused
it into his pages, than any writer on this side the
Atlantic.&rdquo;</p>

class="footnote">[142]</a>&nbsp; It must not be understood,
however, from this statement, that I wished to invite to these
expositions only such individuals as are mentioned above, I must
candidly confess that it was not altogether without reference to
yourselves.&nbsp; I hoped that by these occasional meetings we
should come somewhat nearer into contact: and that, as a
consequence, feelings of love and of kindness might more
diffusively prevail.&nbsp; It afforded me, therefore, real
pleasure to see so many of you kindly giving me the meeting on
the two evenings on which I have been in your neighbourhood.</p>
<p><a name="footnote146"></a><a href="#citation146"
class="footnote">[146]</a>&nbsp; It has been strangely imagined,
and even reported by some, that I do not wish those who consider
themselves Methodists to join with the rest of my people in
partaking of the sacrament, and that I object likewise to
administer it to them at their own houses, when unable to attend
the church.&nbsp; I feel pleasure in availing myself of this
opportunity of assuring them, that such statements are altogether
erroneous.&nbsp; My heart rejoices to see them whenever they
attend: for it reminds me of that general assembly in heaven,
where all party distinctions will be lost in one common feeling
of love, and when we shall all join in sweetest unison in singing
that new and never-ending song.&nbsp; My feelings also are
similar when kneeling around their beds of sickness, and
consecrating those elements of which we are about to partake in
remembrance of that Redeemer who has taught us so emphatically
that his disciples should love one another.</p>
<p><a name="footnote164"></a><a href="#citation164"
class="footnote">[164]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;Unquestionably our
aristocratical manners and habits have made us and the poor two
distinct and unsympathising bodies; and, from want of sympathy, I
fear the transition to enmity is but too easy when distress
embitters the feelings, and the sight of others in luxury makes
that distress still more intolerable.&nbsp; This is the
plague-spot to my mind in our whole state of society, which must
be removed, or the whole must perish.&nbsp; And under God it is
for the clergy to come forward boldly, and begin to combat
it.&nbsp; If you read Isaiah iii., v., and xxxii.; Jeremiah v.,
xxii., and xxx.; Amos iv.; Habakkuk ii.; and the Epistle of St.
James, written to the same people a little before the second
destruction of Jerusalem, you will be struck, I think, with the
close resemblance of our own state to that of the
Jews.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Dr. Arnold&rsquo;s Letters</i>, vol. i. p.
286.</p>
<p><a name="footnote171"></a><a href="#citation171"
class="footnote">[171]</a>&nbsp; At the date of this letter, the
public mind was much agitated by the question of Parliamentary
Reform, and an alarming spirit of lawlessness prevailed in many
parts of the kingdom.&nbsp; In a few weeks after this was
written, the city of Bristol was for about two days in the hands
of a numerous mob; setting all authority at defiance, and
committing the most fearful depredations, burnings, &amp;c.&nbsp;
These events, happening within a few miles of Mr. M.&rsquo;s
residence, would doubtless increase his forebodings as to his
native land, and his desire to remove to a foreign scene of
ministerial labour.</p>

class="footnote">[226]</a>&nbsp; Mr. Ditcher, now vicar of South
Brent, Somers, had succeeded Mr. Mortimer in the curacy of
Hutton, where Mr. Armstrong was paying him a visit; he suggested
that, being in the house lately occupied by their mutual friend,
Mr. A. should write to him from the same, which he did
accordingly.&nbsp; It is from this circumstance that the allusion
to Mr. Ditcher is made.</p>
<p><a name="footnote252"></a><a href="#citation252"
class="footnote">[252]</a>&nbsp; On the 10th of October, 1841,
Mr. Mortimer preached at Thornhill, in the evening, for the first
time after his nervous attack.&nbsp; His text was very
striking&mdash;&ldquo;I shall not die but live, and declare the
works of the Lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; After that he preached
occasionally in the evening, until he altogether resumed his
duties, about the middle of the year 1843.</p>

minds of those who widely differed from him, and perhaps viewed
the Church to which he belonged with much prejudice, was not
attained but by a course of great kindness and consideration
towards all, and the thing gained was worth all the cost of
it.&nbsp; Mr. Mortimer was not an indifferent Churchman; but he
felt that, like his Divine Master, he should not only be of a
<i>meek and lowly</i> spirit towards his own, but that he should
exercise tenderness and conciliation to the Samaritan as well as
to the Jew; to the Dissenter as well as to the Churchman;
considering all as entitled to the benefits of his flock, though
they were not disposed to partake of them.&nbsp; It will be said,
perhaps, that many Dissenters are not only bitter in their
spirit, but violent in their language, and provoking in their
conduct and actions.&nbsp; If it be so, let us set them a better
example; let us show them a more excellent way; let us make them
the objects of our kindness and prayers, and not of our scorn,
hatred, and opposition.&nbsp; &ldquo;Be not overcome of evil, but
overcome evil with good.&rdquo;</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
